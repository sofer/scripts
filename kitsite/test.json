The Welsh landing page is fine as we'll just give it a different name (Cyfnewid y Fflam Olympiadd apparently), but some of the place names are the same in Welsh and English (e.g. Bangor).  So, my question, could we put the Welsh pages in a sub directory so that they can have the same name if required.\n\nFor example, have the English Bangor page here:\nlondon2012.com/games/olympic-torch-relay/olympic-torch-relay-route/bangor\n\nAnd the Welsh one here:\nlondon2012.com/games/olympic-torch-relay/olympic-torch-relay-route/cy/bangor\n\nWould this break the navigation for example?\n\nDeborah - fyi\n\nRegards,\nAndy\n\nAndy Watkins\nNew Media Project Manager\nNew Media, Communications and Public Affairs\nDirect line:  +44 (0)203 2012 736\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nOne Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)203 2012 000\nFax: +44 (0)207 7191 308\nlondon2012.comhttp://www.london2012.com/\n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email","organization_id":40584,"field_177410":null,"assignee_name":"Lars Bortfeldt","problem_id":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":18087822},{"channel":null,"nice_id":3367,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/03/30 10:56:16 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0.35","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:20 +0100","resolution_time":481,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"authorized bill_separately level_0 none_required tested this_week","assignee_id":3690996,"updated_at":"2011/04/18 12:35:05 +0100","req_name":"Morag Reavley","linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2011/04/18 12:35:05 +0100","solved_at":"2011/04/18 12:35:05 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"bill_separately","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/04/11 11:47:24 +0100","score":30,"via_id":27,"subject":"Re: Young Leaders website","recipient":"support+id440@postcms.zendesk.com","group_id":61946,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:22 +0100","ticket_id":39408059,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/03/29 12:18:11 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/13 18:50:47 +0100","ticket_id":39408059,"value":"0.35"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/03/31 13:51:02 +0100","ticket_id":39408059,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:22 +0100","ticket_id":39408059,"value":"bill_separately"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:22 +0100","ticket_id":39408059,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/03/29 12:18:11 +0100","updated_at":"2011/03/29 12:18:11 +0100","ticket_id":39408059,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/03/29 12:18:11 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/01 14:40:54 +0100","ticket_id":39408059,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/01 14:40:54 +0100","ticket_id":39408059,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/01 14:40:54 +0100","ticket_id":39408059,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/01 14:40:54 +0100","ticket_id":39408059,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:22 +0100","ticket_id":39408059,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/10 12:16:18 +0100","ticket_id":39408059,"value":"1"}],"submitter_id":3692462,"base_score":30,"comments":[{"created_at":"2011/03/29 11:09:20 +0100","via_id":27,"value":"This is a follow-up to your previous request #440 \"Young Leaders website\"\n\nHello Lars\n\nJust spotted a few things with the YL blog:\n\n\n1.

We have a bit of a problem with Young Leaders.\r\n\r\nMorag says it's not necessarily the young leaders that are doing the blog posts. See e.g. http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/young-leaders/blog/dame-kelly-holmes/young-leaders-lives-will-be-transformed-by-being-part-of.php (Kelly Holmes is not a Young Leader). She also says that they want the blogs sorted by team, not by author. I am not sure if the way it works now allows for that.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the only teams with a blog comment already in them on staging are East riding, Greenwich, Hull and Tower Hamlets 2.\r\n\r\nNote also, that the teams need to be rationalized. See #3394. I think when they are, Aberdeen should also be visible (although Tower Hamlets 2 might not be).\r\n\r\nMorag is also keen that the team should be visible and linkable in each blog post, as it is here: http://london2012.collectiveldn.com/young-leaders/meet/index2.html\r\n\r\nI think it is also a bit harder for the teams to all work nicely on staging, because while we have the indexing switched off (which we now do), I imagine that no new posts will show up in the right team on staging. I don't think this is something we should attempt to address, because Young Leaders should nave have been left on staging in a half-finished state for so long (my fault, really--the work was sandwiched between other urgent pieces of work and it rather got ignored), but it may be confusing for Morag if she doesn't see new (or changed) posts showing up in the right place on staging.\r\n\r\nI do suggest that Jamie has a quick chat with Morag to resolve what to do and he then gives Lars a clearer brief than he got from me. This was a more subtle piece of work than I realised.

I know, promo1 isn't giving away much ) WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU CAN RENAME BUT KEEP THE FILENAME THE SAME?! \r\n\r\nJust meant that the name of the include is currently 'promo 1' and i thought if you'd fancy renaming it, it would be fine to do so. Maybe you get a different kind of window but if i do a right-click and go for rename i have a couple of options, like name and filename. It would be ok if you'd change the name but it would break things if you would change the filename ( which maybe you cannot see the field ) \r\n\r\nLet me know if you run into problems, will try and solve them asap\r\nLars","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3690996},{"created_at":"2011/04/06 18:39:40 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Thanks Lars\n\nYes, the way you’ve done the Evening Celebration thing is right, thanks\n\nWill have a look at the promo naming tmrw\n\nd\n\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3692169},{"created_at":"2011/04/07 11:10:25 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Marking this ticket as solved.
