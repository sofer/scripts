Delivery: by end of August

2011/07/14,4568,open,Andy Watkins,"Generation of General XML Google sitemap (not incl news/video/photos - these have separate tickets)",London 2012,,General sitemap, a couple things we need to deal with, which make it tricker than just looking though all the page son the site and outputting an XML file.

a) Excluding pages that are in the CMS but aren't normally navigable to. As you say everything that does not have 'hide from navigation' should appear, but it's not quite as simple as we do have pages that are excluded by section for example signup pages and test directories.

Probably the best thing here is for us to create the site map and then have a run though it and see if we can spot any pages that shouldn't be in it.

b) Splitting the files out into multiple files to get round the Google limit of 5000 pages, not an issue per sea but need to do a few queries to work out who to split the site up , probably best if we separate out the sections with large amounts of content, ie. news, images, suppliers and then leave another file with just standard 'content' pages.

Will run some counts of the top sections to work out where to split.

c) Updates, once again not an issue per sea. but we've been discussing internally how best to handle this in the CMS as generating a site map for the whole site each day (or more frequently) is fairly processor heavy.

We can start with a new sitemap generated at say 2am each night.

d) "Virtual hub pages" this is a very interesting one, especially as we're about to relaunch the News section using this format/method. By "Virtual hub pages" I mean hub pages (ie. "Culture News") that don't actually exist in he CMS but are instead created 'on the fly' via a url such as "london2012.com/news?tag=culture" or london2012.com/photos?tag=culture". Currently Google will find these pages via it's crawler, so there is no issue. But once we switch to using a sitemap there seems to be consensus (via a bit of googling) that results from crawling can drop once you are actively serving a site map (I expect Larry Page n isn't even sure and that half of this stuff is old wives tales / speculation).

I think Danny/Kieran have already proposed some work/costs as an extension to the SEO work (copying Danny/Kieran in on this response) to store these urls in the CMS, so that you could link to /news/culture in the CMS but that would actually be mapped to /news?tag=culture. If we did this then we'd have a list of all those 'psudo hub pages' and could export them in the sitemap.

In the immediate term, I assume we'll just have to live without them and hope Google doesn't start to drop the hub pages for given topics (ie. Culture News). In the medium term, if we haven't completed the work above, I guess we could hardcode a sitemap of urls for the key 'pseudo hub pages'.

Hi Morag,

The translator has advised me that it may take up until the 14th to translate all the files - however we would continue to deliver them as and when ready as we have been doing so far, so that the vast majority of the files would be uploaded prior to that date.

Apologies for this delay, and if this new timescale isn't acceptable please let me know.

Hi Morag,

Apologies for the delayed reply.  I'm afraid you're right - we were on time up until last week but have fallen behind due to the Bank holidays - many apologies that these weren't taken into account in the initial schedule.  I am just about to upload the latest batch of files, which will mean that all files highlighted in orange on the attached list are uploaded - I am asking the translator now about a schedule for the rest of the files and will update you as soon as I can.

Again, many apologies for this and I will do my utmost to ensure that the remaining files are uploaded asap - if necessary I will split the files between two linguists, but I will keep you informed if this happens.

2011/06/29,3661,open,Liz Goulding,"re-opening case sensitive URLs",London 2012,,My view is that we don’t need to look at existing short URLs (although it would be nice if we could tell if they had the case-insensitive attribute), but we should enable the mod_speling thing, which Mr SEO has funnily enough just asked for this last week. His specific comments as follows:

“I typically deploy the following two rules on every web project that I work on:
1. 301 all requests with no subdomain specified to the www. equivalent of the URL (e.g. a request for london2012.com should 301 to www.london2012.com and a request for london2012.com/sports should 301 to www.london2012.com).
2. 301 all requests with uppercase characters to their lower case equivalent. (e.g. a request for www.london2012.com/Sports would redirect to www.london2012.com/sports) - before implementing this ensure that canonical URL can only be specified with lower case characters.
Simple Apache rules exist to implement this logic. Once the rules are in place a request for london2012.com/Sports would redirect to www.london2012.com/sports.”

Kieran, can you comment on doability?

2011/04/08,3481,open,Liz Goulding,"FW: Exporting problem",London 2012,,Hiya, Here is there update on this:

Some of the exporting issues are resolved ie I can now see the names – but now other fields are not appearing. And some correspond to last year eg. the column header refers to ‘challenge’ but this year we are not having a challenge as such. And now when you export the data we do not seem to have a postal address (which is where we would send the promotional kits.)

Anyway, I think what would be the most useful thing is for me to detail exactly what all the fields are on the registration form – as these are what we need. I had planned to cross check these fields with the column headers on the exported excel document but I didn’t have time today and I’m not in the office tomorrow.

Anyway, listed below are the fields that we ask for when they register and these should correspond to the data which we export in terms of column headers.

Thankyou!
