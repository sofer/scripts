(as that is what we do for the normal user uploaded images) and then appearing in latest user uploads, which is totally wrong in both cases.\n\nWill see what I can do here, to be honest with you, had I known (and this is a leftover from Marna/I know we have been here before) I would never have let us allow images to be uploaded the way they are, as the backend UGC API's are geared up for accepting user uploaded images and not for images attached to an event. The problem was we had already started using it in this way and I was concerned that ripping it all out and starting again was going to cause more issues (in fact I should have just stopped that feature being used till we had a new backend built).\n\nI know the requirement seems really basic, but we have no off the shelf mechanism for letting users submit a front end form *with* an image attached so that the image and details comes though in the back end tied together (we also have the issue of how to allow you to approve/reject the image in the event editor itself). Had I known (and yes I should have kept a better eye on Marna and the requests she was agreeing to!) this was a serious requirement we would have proposed to construct the Event upload stuff totally differently (although it would have required a much larger amount of custom code, so possibly would have suggested that we ask users to just add a link to any assets/images they wanted us to use as an easy/cost effective workaround).\n\nIn short we're half way into the woods on this one and I wish I could get out as I feel I'm digging an even deeper hole ;-)\n\nAnyway, back to question at hand..\n\n- We'll add in some logic to stop pages being created for these images.\n- That should stop them appearing in 'latest' images.\n\nAs so for assigning, I think you should be able to assign the un-approved images in the Events' editor ie. you wont' need to approve them first and then as soon as the events get published the images wil get approved/published.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/07/12 14:24:10 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"No no, the images coming through for event pictures are just being ‘assigned’ to individual event pages.

I though we we;re already doing this)\n- I then identify and move all the OW images (regardless of status) into this new folder\n- We scrap any approve/reject workflow [attaching an image to an event is in effect approving it]\n- We then just reply on the fact that if you attach an image to a page and published it, the image gets published to.\n\n* The ideal would be to assign the image to the Event when we create the Event page, the problem here is that if we do that then when the event gets published the images goes with it / we have no way to approve reject the image in the events editor. We could work the other way round and assign the image and then rely on editors to clear any image they didn't want used?\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/07/12 14:48:11 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Ok this sounds good.

This way is something breaks at the the app level, the includes can be commented out and the default configuration tested in isolation ie. a clear division of responsibility/ who's responsibility it is to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nMoving into a production environment I would say it is imperative that the 6 live and 2 staging servers all share a common server configuration file (where possible) that is generated 'on the fly' from a single master file, which is held in a version control system like SVN or Git and that this is normally seen as a task for the systems team.\r\n\r\nHowever if in the interests of just getting things moving ;-) if you want us to just set one up for the time being, could you get stage3.london2012.com and stage4.london2012.com setup as sub domains (I think Demy's do this?). That way we can add them as a ServerName which will make accessing them for testing easier.\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/06/29 12:08:48 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Jamie, can you just confirm: do you want us to bill 2 days just for this or does this include http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/1029?","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/07/07 16:26:06 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi Danny,\r\n\r\nThis is ticket 1029 ;) but the other ticket is for the integration of the server into the ongoing workflow at the moment we're just setting it up as a one time thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far:\r\n\r\n- Setup Apache httpd.conf on both servers\r\n- Synced a copy of the site from web01 to stage04\r\n- Setup domain names\r\n- Replaced all the base hrefs\r\n- Uploaded DSA_SLA_test_pages\r\n- Time spent researching, investigating and responding to emails\r\n- Setup Expires and ETags on staging servers\r\n- Synced staging servers\r\n\r\nAmongst other tasks, so far I have spent at least two days on this, but it's a bit of a rolling target / ticket..","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/07/26 12:15:36 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Marking as solved.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/07/26 12:17:56 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Jamie, re my stupid comment: \"do you want us to bill 2 days just for this or does this include http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/1029?\"\r\n\r\nI meant http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/1030.","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3640926}],"linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":4,"status_updated_at":"2010/10/24 12:15:50 +0100","solved_at":"2010/07/26 12:15:36 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"bill_to_its","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/06/25 17:58:03 +0100","channel":null,"via_id":0,"subject":"Setup staging server and copy across a one time sync","recipient":null,"group_id":61946,"submitter_id":3686603,"base_score":0,"latest_recipients":null,"due_date":"2010/07/02 12:00:00 +0100","current_collaborators":null,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/06/25 17:55:41 +0100","updated_at":"2010/06/25 17:55:41 +0100","ticket_id":14089112,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/06/25 17:55:41 +0100","updated_at":"2010/06/25 17:55:41 +0100","ticket_id":14089112,"value":"2"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/06/25 17:55:41 +0100","updated_at":"2010/06/29 13:57:31 +0100","ticket_id":14089112,"value":"4"},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/06/25 17:55:41 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/12 11:04:21 +0100","ticket_id":14089112,"value":"bill_to_its"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/06/25 17:55:41 +0100","updated_at":"2010/08/25 16:25:06 +0100","ticket_id":14089112,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/06/25 17:55:41 +0100","updated_at":"2010/06/29 13:57:31 +0100","ticket_id":14089112,"value":"2"}],"status_id":4,"field_148059":"","description":"Setup staging server and copying across a one time sync of web01\r\n\r\n(there is a separate ticket dealing with integrating the two new staging servers into the existing publication work flow and modifying the rsync as ness.)","problem_id":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"2","assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":9634933},{"nice_id":1113,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/07/21 11:25:20 +0100","field_358835":"","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0.2","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/07/20 14:44:28 +0100","score":0,"resolution_time":140,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"authorized bill_separately","assignee_id":4323506,"updated_at":"2010/10/24 11:15:54 +0100","req_name":"Morag Reavley","comments":[{"created_at":"2010/07/20 14:44:28 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"\r\nI'm really sorry to ask but I can't get hte promos to appear in alphabetical order on this page: http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/volunteer/games-maker-roles-and-venues/teams-and-roles/index.php \r\n\r\nThey should run in the same order as in the left hand nav.
