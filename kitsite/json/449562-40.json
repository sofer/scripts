It looks as if you use Renderer to serialize a fake page that inherits from a master template, none of the containers in the child template are included in the serialization. \r\nThe code is in dialogs/create-blogger.jsp \r\n\r\nMust admit, on reflection I'm somewhat puzzled that this ever worked - there's nothing to explicitly say \"serialize empty fragments\", after all. But nevertheless - if you compare results (on dev) between london2012 and new2012, you'll see that on new2012 only fields from the master template are rendered (I've put some temporary debug in data-form.xsl which dumps out the input doc to make this clearer - do a view source to see it).\r\n\r\nI could fix this by completely recoding the jsp - eg. using template.applyTransform(). Actually, that would probably be a good idea. But I'm concerned that this discrepancy between master/non-master templates could cause other problems, so I thought I'd throw it your way first to get your opinion.","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":false,"author_id":3635967}],"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2009/12/22 11:48:02 +0000","updated_at":"2009/12/22 11:48:02 +0000","ticket_id":6200055,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/01/07 14:48:02 +0000","updated_at":"2010/01/15 12:53:19 +0000","ticket_id":6200055,"value":"0.5"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2009/12/22 11:48:02 +0000","updated_at":"2009/12/22 11:48:02 +0000","ticket_id":6200055,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2009/12/22 11:48:02 +0000","updated_at":"2009/12/22 11:48:02 +0000","ticket_id":6200055,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2009/12/22 11:48:02 +0000","updated_at":"2009/12/22 11:48:02 +0000","ticket_id":6200055,"value":""}],"latest_recipients":"support+id349@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"status_id":4,"field_148059":"","description":"Hi,\n\nJust went to blog/author to add a pic but the box for me to upload has\ngone.
