So we can't add an \"if\" on the Event page saying \"if image is approved show it\" as publishing the event will have forced the image to be approved/published. We possibly could create a custom workflow for OW images but all of the workflow in the current Default workflow would need to be duplicated. This is what we probably need to do but worried about the knock on effect here, is it better to leave it as it is for the time being [and look again next time we do something like this] seeing as most event have already been uploaded.\r\n\r\n* I think the above was the original plan but the issue of the image being published when the page was published it was taken out.\r\n\r\n2) Ignoring the above, as it makes this point kind of irrelevant, we can't store a reference on the Image back to the Event on the image as:\r\n\r\n      a) we create the Event page after the Image, although I suppose we could try and create a unique key which is stored in the image name/filename and a meta-data field on the Event \r\n      b) we can't set any meta-data on the image other than tags (which show up on the front end), although we could possibly do this via the filename (I think we can set the filename independently of the image name)\r\n\r\n3) There are no references on any of the current images or events, so whatever we did now would only be of use for newly uploaded events. We'd also have a clean up job to do as some pages would have a user assigned / image container and new pages a image meta data field and some display code. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf we we're to go down the route (in future);\r\n\r\n1) Create image and set the filename to ow-#eventname#-#uniquenumber#.jpg [assuming this is possible? it may not be possibel to set the filename separately form the image]\r\n\r\n2a) Save this is a new /uploads/ow folder (so we can separate them out form the normal user uploads) / create a new tab in the CMS\r\n2b) Alternatively add a 'origin' to the upload servlet and filtering to the approval screen.\r\n\r\n3) Store the path to this image on the Event in a metadata 'string' field (not an image container or else it will be published)\r\n\r\n4) On the Event page check for the existence of a image field, check if an image with that name exists in a given section and then if has been approved display it. In edit mode we may want to indicate that their is an image that needs approval.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI know what Liz would really like is a screen where an image could be assign internally or externally, with a little 'approve/reject' tick-box under it for any external images, but can't see that happening as the development costs outweigh the use.\r\n\r\nSorry long email/response, with no clear conclusion..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":false,"author_id":3686603}],"latest_recipients":"support+id1055@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":"Jamie Unwin","status_id":4,"field_148059":"awaiting_authorization","description":"Bug.

So if a post code were entered, finding events within a certain radius?\n\nIf you mean the CMS then that's a bit of a red herring, as the CMS only allows you to assign a postcode (or lat/long).\n\nI assume you mean can we add a postcode to the front end search, the answer is yes but it's not just a case of adding a postcode field to the form nor do we have some ready to use code to deploy out of the box.\n\nSome sites do this in a hacky way by /trying to/ (it's not accurate) stripping off the first bit of postcode entered up until a latter or space ie. 'N1 4DG' or 'N14DG' and then trying to match any postcode starting with those letters. That however doesn't deal with borders very well ie. N1 next to E8 \n\nThe proper way is to do it is to add a lat/long to every event, you get this for free if you use the location picker in the CMS but not from user submitted events. Then when someone does a search we also turn the postcode they entered into a lat/long coordinate and then for each result returned use a bit of maths to work out the distance between the two points and therefore whether it falls within an acceptable radius.\n\nThe short answer is no we don't have it and no we couldn't implement it this week.\n\nBut if it is a feature you want (and if your dealing with events it does obviously makes sense) we can look at implementing it\n\nAlthough it would almost certainly take the best part of a week to get up and running as we need to upgrade the search engine, write some wrapper code, update the search form, get the back end of the form to turn the postcode entered into a lat/long, assign lat/longs to all the legacy events, set it up so it does this automatically in future, test, deploy, test etc.\n\n> 2) Could we just show the postcode of the event next to the date it's occurring? Apparently people want to be able to tell at a glance if it's near them\n\n\nYou mean in the results? if so, certainly, mainly (*) just a case of deciding where it goes.\n\n* I think we also need to refresh/republish all the events as I don't think we currently store the postcode in the 'front end' search engine, so we would first need to add it as a indexable field and bulk update all the events so we can pull it back out when people do a search.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/06/22 16:52:46 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"1) For curiosity for future development, can you quote how long it would take?\n\n2) Yeah, that’s precisely what i mean.
