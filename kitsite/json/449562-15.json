I can ask BT to check with regards to the testing, however, their testing team is currently busy on another project, and the adistars project will be their next port of call. Can KitSite be asked how they are pulling the products into our site (I can do this if you prefer) – depending on what solution they are implementing we may be able to get away with this without BT having to do long strenuous testing...”\n\nCan you provide an answer to Jag’s question above re: how the products are being pulled in?

This ticket was raised because at least some of the SHOULD appear in search results.\r\n\r\nHowever \"hide-from-navigation\" is used elsewhere in the site to mean something different - rather obviously, to indicate that a page shouldn't appear in local navigation.\r\n\r\nSo, if there are pages that REALLY need to be excluded from site-search results then we should add a new flag - say \"hide-from-search\".\r\n\r\nI guess I need answers to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Which of these pages should NOT appear in site-search results.\r\n\r\n2. If the answer to (1.) is non-zero, can you authorise an additional 1 day for the addition of a \"hide-from-search\" checkbox, testing (once staging env. is in place), and deployment?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKieran\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/19 12:40:40 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"I believe that there may be a couple of instances where i ‘hide from search’ would be useful, other instances where it might be better just to expire pages. but would need to confirm with colleagues in other depts, so could do with a day or two before anything happens on this.\n\nSorry about the slight delay\n\nd\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692169},{"created_at":"2010/10/19 18:59:15 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Tell Kieran which ones you want hidden, please, Debs.

Once we deploy the code we're going to test it works and I can't see any possibility of it bringing the server down after we have confirmed it works, if in the worse case scenario a bug did get in then we'd obviously roll back the change immediately. Therefore the impact on BT is zero and the impact on the rest of the business is similar to an editorial change that has been checked.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it the rational for CAB is so that:\r\n\r\ni) Should a problem arise with the servers BT/IPSOFT/ITS (or the help desk) can look back and see what has changed and therefore decide whether an incident may be affected by a recent change. This really makes most sense in terms of server configuration changes (something we have been increasingly reluctant to do for a while now, for exactly these reason) and not content, markup or template changes.\r\n\r\nii) CAB can decide that it's not a good idea for a change to be made in case it clashes with (for example) a political sensitive date/event or another significant change due to happen round that time (ie. a change to the network).\r\n\r\nIn terms of timescale I'm passing that bit over to Kieran to answer.\r\n\r\nAlthough I would expect we'd be able to get it done this month.\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/11/09 12:54:00 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Thanks for this response.
