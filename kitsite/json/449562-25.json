Plus testing, integration, tweaks etc. (the actual coding will probably  turn out to be the smallest part of the work, but the more parties involved the more these things tend to eat up time, hence why I have priced this a day more than we may normally have to cover tweaks, emails, questions, interrogation, panics :) etc. \r\n\r\nBut a couple of questions:\r\n\r\n- Will the form be largely based largely on the Atos one http://locog.metroserver.co.uk/ (but re-coded form scratch to deal with accessibility issues) \r\n\r\n- Will Ability.net supply the initial recommendations upfront? \r\n\r\n- Do we just need to send a single email to the call center (will the confirmation email and the rest of the sign-up be handled by the call center?)\r\n\r\n- Do you need an accessible Captcha? (I knwo that was the issue with original form so expect not).

One thing I forgot to check is if it is OK for us to host the page and script that sends the emails / stores the submitted details on the www.london2012.com server/domain [but use the branding from the volunteer site]. The reason I suggest this is that is may be more complex / time consuming to host the form page on the ATOS' server and if we do it on the www. server we have full control.

I'll expect you'll answer no, was \nhoping you could explain that...\n\n<content:select id=\"eventRegion\" title=\"Region\" isMetaData=\"true\" \ntaxonomy=\"regions\" />\n<content:string id=\"region\" title=\"Region\" taxonomy=\"regions\" \nisMetaData=\"true\"/>\n\n#SuggestedSolution#: Maybe we can just consolidate these into one \nfield? I assume both regions relate to the event not the organiser.\n\n2) We then have these three fields which seem to refer to the venue \nthe event is being held at, is the event location and venue location \nthe same thing?\n\n<content:string id=\"location\" title=\"Location\" taxonomy=\"locations\" \nisMetaData=\"true\"/>\n<content:string id=\"county\" title=\"County\" isMetaData=\"true\" />\n<content:string id=\"venueBorough\" title=\"Venue borough\" \nisMetaData=\"true\" taxonomy=\"boroughs\" />\n\n#Clarification#\n\n3) Once we have got to the bottom of the above there is the question \nof locations vs regions, regions just seem to be a subset of location.\n\nRegions: http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/_system/taxonomy/regions.xml\nLocation: http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/_system/taxonomy/locations.xml\n\n#Root cause#: I expect what happened here, is that at some point the \nOW team requested a bigger set of 'locations/regions' than the current \nregions.xml taxonomy contained. So Marna added them in but then those \nextra values showed up in *ALL* region meta-data inputs on the site or \nin the CMS. So she created a new taxonomy called locations.xml just \nfor the OW events.\n\n#Problem#: The problem there is that we have i) two inputs that \noverlap each other ii) a new field 'location' that won't get related \nto articles tagged by 'region'.\n\n#SuggestedSolution#:\n\nWe add the new fields to the region taxonomy and then live with the \nfact that those extra fields show up as options whenever region is \navailable in the CMS.\nWe can drop Region and keep Location, but nothing will relate by \nregion anymore.\nWe keep and consolidate down to Location (ie. a the wider region \ntaxonomy) and /try/ to be clever and always save off a value in a \nhidden Region field *if* the Location is contained in the region \ntaxonomy (this may end up be more trouble / problematic than it's worth)\n\n4) Back to the original question\n\nAfter we have covered the above, we can back to the original question, \nbut first a couple of questions:\n\n- Which 'region' field are we looking at?\n\nIf we do the above (3) then we will now a single 'location' or \n'region' field which relates to a) the event (which is the same as \nvenue?) b) the organiser's location - delete as appropriate.\n\n- We have county field further down, Is this related? Should the above \nfield sit above it? Is this the second field that is reduced when a \n'Region' (or Location is selected)\n\nIn terms of work, it looks like we actually need to do some clean up \nfirst.\n\nBut the actual implementation of the two pulldowns requires two things:\n\na) Turn both the region (or location) and country fields into pull \ndowns, which should be fairly easy (we need to do it on the OW form, \nthe event form and the CMS screen)\nb) Add in some Javascript functionality (and a config file) to tie the \ntwo fields together.\n\nIf we limit (b) to the frontend (not the CMS *) then it actually makes \nlife simpler, the only tricky thing is that because we already use the \nregion and county taxonomies in their current format elsewhere in the \nCMS we will have to upkeep a 3rd file which contains information about \nboth taxonomies and their nesting. As the region/country values are \nunlikely to change? this is probably isn't an issue, but in other \ncases / other fields it may be.\n\nAnyway I think I probably replied with more questions than answers, \nbut hopefully at the end we'll have a better Events system and I be \nable to more clearly tell you how long a two step pull down for Region/ \nCounty would take (**)\n\nThanks !\n\nJamie\n\n* the form used to edit Events in the CMS is a generic editor, it's \nnot a special interface just for editing events, therefore we can't \neasily add custom functionality, like a two step pull down. We could \nbuild a custom screen/interface for events but we'd be into the 3/4 \ndays or work area, so I won't even suggest it.\n\n** I expect it would be a days work (or just under) to get the pull \ndown working properly across both forms. But it looks like we will \nalso need to spend some time on some clean up / consolidation (will \nhave a better idea of the work involved here after we have discussed \nthe above)","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/04/21 09:35:25 +0100","attachments":[{"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/yp7j3jb5v7qst4n/?name=image001.jpg","size":118715,"created_at":"2010/04/21 09:35:25 +0100","content_type":"image/jpeg","token":"yp7j3jb5v7qst4n","id":4726673,"filename":"image001.jpg","is_public":true}],"via_id":4,"value":"Jamie,\n\n \n\nFirst of all - I warned them this might not be an easy piece of work!\nSo if it's more than one day, that's fine!\n\n \n\n1) I would love it if there was only one region field.

The way these fields match up in the back-end has always\nconfused me a bit. Right now, we just have a drop down to select a\nregion.

It's just lots of legacy unused fields is just hording and causes confusion.\r\n\r\nIf so we'll remove all traces of it (and do clean up if required)\r\n\r\n3) With the above no clear in my mind (sorry should have been clear first time round).\r\n\r\n- We convert the new consolidated 'Region' and 'Counties' fields to a pulldowns.\r\n\r\n- We add the two stage / cascading pull down to the public form (we can't do this in the CMS the second will just contain all values as it currently does)\r\n\r\n- We'll need the correlation between Regions -> Counties (lets talk best format separately, if you don't already have as a single file)\r\n\r\nTo code,deploy, test the above will take a day.\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/04/22 17:13:22 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"1) 27 brownie points given. You can even have chocolate ones. I'm not\neating chocolate this month - so it's a special treat. :-)\n\n \n\n2) I need to make sure that the legacy stuff the event address is the\nless important field. Was it event or org address that we were\ncollecting? I just want to make sure we don't lose the actual address\n(the one that gets sent through to the map). In fact, can you just\nconfirm which that is? The other legacy one should be ok to remove.\n\n \n\n3) Helpful. I can send you the dependency list separately and that will\nall be clear. \n\n \n\nAnd the day quote is also helpful. I will feed back to the team and\ncheck if they want to do it (they might not, so don't get too carried\naway!)\n\n \n\nThanks, Jamie.\n\n \n\nLiz Goulding\n\nNew Media Producer\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\n\nDirect line: +44 (0) 203 2012 297\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nwww.london2012.com  \n\nwww.twitter.com/london2012 \n\n________________________________\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3709935},{"created_at":"2010/04/26 12:01:49 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Waiting to get go ahead on this...","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/04/28 09:33:50 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"We have the go ahead (see email \"FW: Regional stuff for Open Weekend\").
