Right now there are\njust 'business, culture, edu, sport, sustain, volunteering' and open\nweekend could add another 15 or so categories. I have the following\nideas:\n\n \n\n1) just add in a bunch more in the existing drop down. It will be\na bit messy, but probably the easiest\n\n2) create a second dropdown for 'open weekend' only events\n\n3) create a 'tag cloud' of all the types, rather than a drop down!\nWill be more visually pleasing/navigable and allow for little types that\nonly occur once or twice to be represented accordingly.\n\n \n\nALSO\n\n \n\nThey want a 'fill in another' button after the form is submitted. This\nway, an organiser with many events can click on the 'another' button\n(only at the time of submission, they don't have to log in or go away\nfor a long time) and auto-populate the form with the main contact\ndetails again.\n\n \n\nThis all MUST be done by early Feb, but we would like to prioritise this\nalong with the non open weekend event form to be done in the next week\nor two.
