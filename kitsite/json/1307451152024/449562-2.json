The sites are 99% populated with images and content but there's still the odd thing here and there that's going wrong with the templates and it's stopping us sending previews to sports managers who are expecting them today\r\n\r\n- Please see my reply to Danny's email re: the sponsor / IF logo space in the footer. That one's quite urgent.\r\n\r\n- Homepage includes are showing up in sports' Homepage preview view for some sports but not all. E.g. if you preview Basketball homepage you'll see two includes appear and are working fine. The same folder structure is in place for e.g. Beach Volleyball and BMX but the populated includes do not appear in Homepage preview for those sports.\r\n\r\n- Has the functionality been built for us to determine which pages appear in the bottom left of the footer yet? I think this was something that was going to be added to metadata on pages? There are currently a couple of 'lorem ipsum' links in the footers that will need to either be changed or removed according to whether they're necessary for each sport\r\n\r\n- Some sections of various templates that are populated with text are not appearing in preview. See Spectator Info (Content) page for Beach Volleyball as an example - entire section from 'Tickets' heading to 'Contact us' heading isn't appearing. Also occuring on Homepage template for Equestrian, all text in main body of page disappears in preview.\r\n\r\n- This is something that I know you wanted to leave to the last minute, but the white gaps between different sections of the content template could do with shortening when you're ready please. See the Spectator Info template in Basketball as an example. The depth of the white space between different populated sections of the Content template can be halved I think.\r\n\r\n- All bulletpoints should appear as bullets rather than dashes please?\r\n\r\n- A quick heads-up: we'll need to change the copyright text in the bottom right hand corner in the footer once we had it.

Thats the way it currently works. The left side has way more space then the right, using more than the available space will look a bit nasty.\r\n\r\nAs long as they are 36px high, you can use any wideness.

The sites are 99% populated with images and content but there's still the odd thing here and there that's going wrong with the templates and it's stopping us sending previews to sports managers who are expecting them today\r\n\r\n- Please see my reply to Danny's email re: the sponsor / IF logo space in the footer. That one's quite urgent.\r\n\r\n- Homepage includes are showing up in sports' Homepage preview view for some sports but not all. E.g. if you preview Basketball homepage you'll see two includes appear and are working fine. The same folder structure is in place for e.g. Beach Volleyball and BMX but the populated includes do not appear in Homepage preview for those sports.\r\n\r\n- Has the functionality been built for us to determine which pages appear in the bottom left of the footer yet? I think this was something that was going to be added to metadata on pages? There are currently a couple of 'lorem ipsum' links in the footers that will need to either be changed or removed according to whether they're necessary for each sport\r\n\r\n- Some sections of various templates that are populated with text are not appearing in preview. See Spectator Info (Content) page for Beach Volleyball as an example - entire section from 'Tickets' heading to 'Contact us' heading isn't appearing. Also occuring on Homepage template for Equestrian, all text in main body of page disappears in preview.\r\n\r\n- This is something that I know you wanted to leave to the last minute, but the white gaps between different sections of the content template could do with shortening when you're ready please. See the Spectator Info template in Basketball as an example. The depth of the white space between different populated sections of the Content template can be halved I think.\r\n\r\n- All bulletpoints should appear as bullets rather than dashes please?\r\n\r\n- A quick heads-up: we'll need to change the copyright text in the bottom right hand corner in the footer once we had it. Will send that through as soon as we get it\r\n\r\n","problem_id":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"0.5","assignee_name":"Lars Bortfeldt","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3734551},{"nice_id":3690,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/04/26 10:51:35 +0100","field_358835":"0.5","field_110059":"4","field_97116":"1.5","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:21 +0100","score":30,"resolution_time":789,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"4 authorized billable level_2 none_required publication tested","assignee_id":3663591,"updated_at":"2011/05/24 13:57:22 +0100","req_name":"Morag Reavley","comments":[{"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:21 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"It would be very useful if, in particular, the homepage takeover rules could be kept separate from the Short URLs, in order to prevent accidental publication of splash pages &c.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/05/03 11:38:09 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Technical solution: add it to the php of the hompage:\r\n\r\nput the redirect into the homepage?\r\nif (-f \"/path/to/.homepage-takeover\") {\r\n read value (read first line that doesn't start with a \"#\").\r\n if there's such a line AND IF %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http(s)?://(www\\.)?(our)?london2012.com/.*$ [NC]\r\n  redirect to value from file\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe procedure for launching splash page is then:\r\nEdit .homepage-takeover:\r\n /path/to/splashpage.html\r\n(add a leading \"#\" to disable it).\r\n\r\nInstructions for ITS will need to be amended, as it is:\r\n .homepage-takeover\r\nwhose promotion from staging -> live will need to be disabled during testing.\r\n\r\nNB  .homepage-takeover should be in the CMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2011/05/04 11:01:45 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Jamie, not sure whether you'll see this as you're only Cc-ed.

Once it is live, the homepage takeover will disappear.\r\n    * Staging/rsync: If (once the functionality is fully-live) you want to test on staging before going live, you will need to specify the following rule in .rsync-filter\r\n      - includes/homepage-takeover.php\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591}],"linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2011/05/24 13:57:21 +0100","solved_at":"2011/05/24 13:57:21 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/04/26 10:51:35 +0100","channel":null,"via_id":0,"subject":"Separate out Short URLs from other mod_rewrite directives in redirects file","recipient":null,"group_id":61946,"submitter_id":3640926,"base_score":30,"latest_recipients":"support+id3690@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":"Jamie Unwin","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","ticket_id":64455531,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/05/24 13:57:21 +0100","ticket_id":64455531,"value":"1.5"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/05/10 17:03:12 +0100","ticket_id":64455531,"value":"4"},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/05/24 13:57:21 +0100","ticket_id":64455531,"value":"billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/05/24 13:57:21 +0100","ticket_id":64455531,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/05/24 13:57:21 +0100","ticket_id":64455531,"value":"2"},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/05/24 13:57:21 +0100","ticket_id":64455531,"value":"0.5"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/05/24 13:57:21 +0100","ticket_id":64455531,"value":"level_2"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/05/24 13:57:21 +0100","ticket_id":64455531,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/05/24 13:57:21 +0100","ticket_id":64455531,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","ticket_id":64455531,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/21 16:38:22 +0100","ticket_id":64455531,"value":"0"}],"status_id":3,"field_148059":"authorized","description":"It would be very useful if, in particular, the homepage takeover rules could be kept separate from the Short URLs, in order to prevent accidental publication of splash pages &c.","problem_id":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"2","assignee_name":"Kieran Topping","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692462},{"nice_id":3992,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/05/17 10:42:35 +0100","field_358835":"0.1","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0.1","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/05/16 16:24:55 +0100","score":15,"resolution_time":189,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"level_0 none_required tested this_week","assignee_id":3663591,"updated_at":"2011/06/06 08:48:56 +0100","req_name":"ITS Operations","comments":[{"created_at":"2011/05/16 16:24:55 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"on new2012, londonprepares and learninglegacy.\r\n\r\nRequested by Paul Bunnell.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/05/24 13:33:05 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Done.

I've tried moving them, rewriting them, rewriting the whole sentence and various other things, but to no avail.\n\nFor example, for Handball the sentence in CMS reads The ball must be made of pure leather and have a circumference of about 58 - 60cm in the men's competition. In the women's competition, the circumference is 54 - 56cm.\nHowever, when it reaches the live site it reads The ball must be made of pure leather and have a circumference of about 58 - 60cm in the men's competition. In the women&apos;s competition, the circumference is 54 - 56cm.\n\nThe same thing is happening on the Modern Pentathlon pages.\nGreek philosopher Aristotle described competitors in the Pentathlon of the ancient Games as the most &apos;perfect sportsmen, because in their bodies strength and speed are combined in beautiful harmony'.\n\nI've managed to get rid of the majority of these cases, but I just can't get rid of these two whatever I do! Do you know what is causing these formatting errors, and how they can be fixed?
