I'd strongly advise against this.\r\n- We could add some clever logic to figure if the user is a screen reader user or not - this would involve some extra work, and I doubt it's strictly necessary to meet accessibility guidelines, but if you want to be 110% sure, I'm more than happy to add it.\r\n\r\nEither way, would be great if we could get this (and the webcam story as well) sorted by the end of the day :)","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":4323506},{"created_at":"2010/09/09 17:56:07 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Sorry Janos – not quite good to go.
