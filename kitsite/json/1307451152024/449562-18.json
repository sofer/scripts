A key highlight this year was the invitation to the public and other dancers to have a go at another dance tradition and for the youngest dancers to mix with the oldest. We were joined by young musicians from Budmouth College supported by the local folk dancing/morris community and a swarthy band of pirates as stewards. Next year, the event will be held on 24 September – so come on down to Weymouth and see that young dancers are having fun and safely holding the English traditional dance alive.

Spoken with Deepak.  It appears we need to isolate the IP address first before it can be whitelisted.  According to Femi, the emails sent on behalf of gamesmaker.london2012.com come from the Atos solution.  The london2012.com domain has been delegated to the email server that sends emails via the accessibility form - so more than likely, 213.120.228.150 belongs to BT but this needs confirmation.\n\n\n\n>> BT (this needs to be routed to BT via Servicedesk) : Can BT please check if this is the external IP address they own?\n\n\n\n>> KitSite (Developers managing the accessibility form solution): As this issue involves the accessibility form, can you ensure the email is formed correctly?  In some cases, a malformed email arising from an incorrectly populated form has been known to be flagged as a Trojan/virus.\n\n\n\nThe emails should ideally be routed via Mimecast to ensure any rogue attachments are filtered and checked (Deepak can confirm this).\n\n\n\nDeepak, can you:\n\na) liaise with KitSite/BT if need be.\n\nb) engage with BT (if they own the email server which is sending these emails out) as necessary - copy emails to all cc'd above.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJagdeep Singh Bhambra\n\nService Engineering Manager\n\nInternet Technology Services\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\nFrom: Jonathan Davis\n\nSent: 24 September 2010 09:46\n\nTo: Sumith Ahmed; Huw Williams; Jagdeep Bhambra; Russ Ede; Morag Reavley; Deepak Khandelwal\n\nCc: Brian Cook; Jo-Anne Ruggieri; Adnan Khaliq; ServiceDesk; Peter Hamilton; Blandine Lassau\n\nSubject: RE: Games Maker email\n\n\n\nDeepak\n\n\n\nPlease engage with ITS to resolve\n\n\n\nKind Regards,\n\n\n\nJonathan Davis\n\nIT Service Delivery Manager\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\n\nOne Churchill Place\n\nLondon E14 5LN\n\n\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nMobile: 07760769400\n\nDDI:+44  (0  302 0120 104\n\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\n\nwww.london2012.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\nFrom: Sumith Ahmed [mailto:SAhmed@careline-services.co.uk]\n\nSent: 24 September 2010 09:37\n\nTo: Jonathan Davis; Huw Williams; Jagdeep Bhambra; Russ Ede; Morag Reavley\n\nCc: Brian Cook; Jo-Anne Ruggieri; Adnan Khaliq; ServiceDesk; Peter Hamilton; Blandine Lassau\n\nSubject: RE: Games Maker email\n\n\n\nHi Jonathan,\n\n\n\nAfter much investigation I can confirm your external IP address\n\n(213.120.22.150) is blacklisted for that reason our supplier are rejecting\n\nall e-mails from support@london2012.com, any e-mails sent directly from\n\nexternal address (hotmail / gmails) are allowed through.\n\n\n\n\n\n213.120.228.150 appears in blacklist because:\n\n\n\nIP Address 213.120.228.150 is listed in the CBL.

When I try to diagnose the error, I get an unhelpful \n\"activexobject not defined\" exception from js/jquery.swfobject.js, a \nfile out of our control.\n\n-mike.\n\nOn Feb 22, 2010, at 5:35 AM, Liz Goulding wrote:\n\n> Hi,\n>\n> Please see the issue below.
