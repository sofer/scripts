If you input an invalid URL you would only get a generic message e.g. 'This is not recognised as an official London 2012 tickets website'. We would supply an extra field in the spreadsheet, with a description of what the specific website relates to.\r\n\r\nField validation: Jag is concerned that having a field into which people can paste URLs is a potential avenue for malicious code injection. Can you advise what checks would be done to prevent people from entering malicious code, or any other security measures you can take? Jag is likely to get this pen tested pre go-live, so I'm keen to shortcircuit any possible objections near to launch. Or do I flip it back to Jag and ask him what he requires?\r\n\r\nTesting: for the pen testing to be carried out, I think we would need staging to be available. I'm not clear whether it will be ready in time for end of Feb though. Jag is now also concerned that if we market the tool to the public (which we will) there is a risk of heavy traffic hitting the data centres. He is keen to involve BT/Akamai in this - not something you need to worry about just now, but just flagging as another reason to leave ourselves plenty of time to test...\r\n\r\nTiming change: we are now aiming for completion and population by 21 February to handover to ITS for their tests, allowing us to go live on 28 February. \r\n\r\nAdditional information:\r\nWe think there will be c. 500 URLs initially\r\n\r\nIn answer to your question, yes, there almost certainly would be more than one valid url per supplier, as some ATRs will have multiple domains and use ticket agencies. I am assuming we can simply enter multiple rows with the same agency but different domains?\r\n\r\nLinks in the info text: the only link we would want I think is the ability in the generic 'Not valid' response to be able to say 'View a full list of authorised ticket resellers' and link through to Ticketmaster. It would be the same message and the same web link in all cases where the URL wasn't valid. I don't think we require to add links to the valid sites - since the user already has the URL, that assumes they are on the site or have been on it.\r\n\r\nReporting on URLs - we would ideally like a weekly spreadsheet report emailed to my colleagues in Brand Protection weekly, plus also the ability to login on an ad hoc basis to download the report. The report would detail the URL plus a time/date stamp for when it was entered. \r\n\r\nBadges - we can drop this element of the brief altogether, on the basis that the ATRs will be provided with some assets by our Brand team, and because it is impossible to create something which is not rip-offable. \r\n\r\nTop Fake sites - this will be a content editable area on the page, where we can update the list  manually. I'm not sure how it will live on the page in relation to the Website checker - they should be close to each other, and ideally stand out clearly. Do you think we require some design work here? I was thinking that a graphic in 2012 font saying 'Fake ticket sites' and 'Tickets website checker' would be enough.\r\n\r\nIn terms of adding / uploading new official sites, I will have a spreadsheet tomorrow of the known authorised domains to date. Hopefully that spreadsheet could be uploaded automatically?

But shout if you'd prefer editing one large XML file.\r\n\r\nWork wise (Excel import aside) there's not going to be much between them as parts of on are harder and other parts easier for us with both routes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/01/27 16:07:24 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hello\n\nSorry for delay in responding – your quick questions always end up taking days for me to answer.

So be aware any radical deviations may cause delays or issues!!\r\n\r\n- The valid message is auto generated like so {vendor} is an official retailer for {list of countries} \r\n\r\n- If the vendor has something entered in the 'extra information' field it can override (or be shown in addition) to the above text, although that 'extra info' text is only plain text (ie. can't contain links).

If not we may be better off using a simpler template, but that's not a quick change (might take us a couple of hours to swap them over and check everything still works).\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/02/24 11:27:15 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"I think Morag will pick most of this up, but can I chip in and say we definitely DON’T want a list of invalid site URLs.

We spoke just now and I haven’t done rigorous testing yet, but to summarise my initial thoughts:\n\n\n1. London2012.com root domain gives an ‘unknown’ message – so needs to be added as a valid entry in the datasheet (I will do this).\n\n2. Might be more logical to have the Results return below the Search box rather than above them – but this depends on how much content there is, as I take your point about not having results below fold. Will get back to you when have shown client!\n\n3. I will source a graphic for the top of the page\n\n4. Email export of false sites – should be sent to Farisha.constable@london2012.com\n\n5. Text for both the valid and invalid retainers should not refer to retailers – can we use the wording on the spreadsheet which takes the form ‘xxx is the Authorised Ticket Reseller for xxxx’\n\n6. ‘Extra information’ messages – will get back to you on whether 'extra information' field needs to override or be shown in addition to the above text\n\n7. Link for official ticket areas page – will confirm next week\n\n8. \"We didn't recognize this retailer. Details »\" – can we change ‘retailer’ to ‘URL’. Less keen on the ‘Details’ link – would rather expose the information if we can – it will just be a link to the official list of authorised resellers on the Tickets site\n\n9. Promos in the right hand side – can we add a second promo (underneath the current one) for Prestige Ticketing (official corporate hospitality) as attached to this email\n\n10. Under the checker – understand your thinking here but I would like to show the client the page with a list of Invalid sites here - if you could turn it on, that would be great). We also discussed a box summarising what the official site is and linking to the non-EU Authorised Ticket Resellers – can that go directly underneath the search box, with the ‘Top fake sites’ underneath that?\n\nI have yet to present this to the client – if you could make the above changes I will do so early next week.\n\nStill have to do more testing but the functionality seems to work brilliantly – thanks so much for everyone’s work on this.

I can't quite believe it after 3 and a half years here! Am seriously hoping that the CMS at the new place is as good as PostCMS and the web people are as nice and patient as Kitsite!\n>  \n> I'm trying to leave things in a tidy state for my successor and have made a list of bugs and changes and things that have come up over the last week or two. I think some of these count as support issues and some of them are development - please could you have a look and let me know which bits you'll need to charge for?\n>  \n> Also, there's going to be a little while between me finishing and the new Communications Officer starting, and so my colleagues will be covering the website in that time and may need some extra support. I'll send another email before I go with their details in so you know who you're talking to.\n>  \n> Thanks!\n>  \n> Sarah \n>  \n> -----------------------------------------------------------\n>  \n> 1) Blog post not appearing on relevant Campaigns page: we'd like this post to appear in the latest news section on this page, but even though we have tagged the post with 'common values' in the Campaigns metadata box it doesn't show up. Please could you investigate?\n>  \n> 2) We'd like to add a couple of lines of text (which can be hyperlinked) under the title on this page: http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news/index.php so that we can direct people to our press releases in case they think the blog is all of our news\n>  \n> 3) I've found that after adding a hyperlink to the picture on the first homepage tab I can change the link but I can't remove it. It would be great to know how to stop it from being a link!\n>  \n> 4) It would be really really helpful if we could add dates to the usage information collected from the e-card, so we can see when people are sending e-cards\n>  \n> 5) On a related point we think we need to put in place some kind of policy so that the data the e-card function stores (including the information we have asked not to have access to) is deleted from the database after a certain time has elapsed, otherwise we could get into data protection hot water! Would it be possible to make sure that the data is deleted six months after it was collected?\n>  \n> 6) In the e-card editor (example) the final field (which allows you to enter some text as the beginning of the message the recipient will get in their email) doesn't seem to work. I tried it and the message just came up as a default \"Sarah sent you an eCard from human rights campaign Liberty.
