Budget:  They think it ought to be less than 2 days (£1400), but given that we often ask for lots of tweaks/changes, they are uncomfortable committing to less than that.  So what I propose is a two day cap on the work, but they will actually charge us by the hour ... which could work out to being less than 1 day.  That is how the New Media team work with them on a retainer, so they are very much trustworthy (and I'll watch them).  So if you can ringfence the £1400 for the next week until they complete work, and then raise a PO for the actual amount, hopefully everyone will be happy.\r\n\r\n2.       Format: One way of keeping the budget down (it will be much easier for them) is a type of email where the logo comes in embedded as a 'linked image'.  To most users connected to the internet, the email will appear just as you've requested.  The only exception is that if someone downloads all their emails, then turns off their internet connection and tries to look at it, the image won't be there.  It's pretty unusual for people to do that - most people stay connected to the internet when reading their emails - but it is technically possible.  If you are ok with that, then I think we're much more likely to keep it to a day's work.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you're happy and I'll get them started!\r\n\r\nLiz\r\n\r\nP.S.  They're working on the export and 2010 events - it should be fixed today/tomorrow.\r\n\r\nLiz Goulding\r\nSenior New Media Producer\r\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\r\nDirect line: +44 (0) 203 2012 297\r\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\r\nwww.london2012.comhttp://www.london2012.com\r\nwww.twitter.com/london2012http://www.twitter.com/london2012","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/04/05 10:06:08 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hiya,\n\nCan I please get an estimate on when this work will be done?\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3709935},{"created_at":"2011/04/05 11:12:25 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"And further update to what they need:\n\nThe email we need is the longer one which includes all the details of the brand centre – the second email on page 2 of the document.

We have a bit of a problem with Young Leaders.\r\n\r\nMorag says it's not necessarily the young leaders that are doing the blog posts. See e.g. http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/young-leaders/blog/dame-kelly-holmes/young-leaders-lives-will-be-transformed-by-being-part-of.php (Kelly Holmes is not a Young Leader). She also says that they want the blogs sorted by team, not by author. I am not sure if the way it works now allows for that.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the only teams with a blog comment already in them on staging are East riding, Greenwich, Hull and Tower Hamlets 2.\r\n\r\nNote also, that the teams need to be rationalized. See #3394. I think when they are, Aberdeen should also be visible (although Tower Hamlets 2 might not be).\r\n\r\nMorag is also keen that the team should be visible and linkable in each blog post, as it is here: http://london2012.collectiveldn.com/young-leaders/meet/index2.html\r\n\r\nI think it is also a bit harder for the teams to all work nicely on staging, because while we have the indexing switched off (which we now do), I imagine that no new posts will show up in the right team on staging. I don't think this is something we should attempt to address, because Young Leaders should nave have been left on staging in a half-finished state for so long (my fault, really--the work was sandwiched between other urgent pieces of work and it rather got ignored), but it may be confusing for Morag if she doesn't see new (or changed) posts showing up in the right place on staging.\r\n\r\nI do suggest that Jamie has a quick chat with Morag to resolve what to do and he then gives Lars a clearer brief than he got from me. This was a more subtle piece of work than I realised.

The para returns are not showing on the index page – all the text runs as one.\n\n2. Is it possible to add a break within the text so that not all the text shows on the index page (as per our normal blog)?\n\n3. Can you remind me how we assign a team name / avatar to a blog post – can we just enter them as normal authors i.e. Aberdeen instead of a person’s name? [You did tell me this but I have forgotten...]\n\n4. Meet the Young Leaders landing page http://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/young-leaders/meet/ - the yellow arrows at the top of the scrolling device don’t look quite right – are they supposed to sit on thumbnail photos like this?\n\nAlso – on the live site, something very odd has happened with the news feed top right:\nhttp://www.london2012.com/young-leaders/index.php You can’t see the actual news stories, just ‘More’, plus when you click ‘More’ it takes you to a French news story. This is not right – please can you investigate asap?\n\n[cid:image001.png@01CBEE01.8D359C70]\n\nFrom: Lars Bortfeldt [mailto:notifications-support@postcms.zendesk.com]\nSent: 11 May 2010 15:33\nTo: Morag Reavley\nSubject: [PostCMS support] Re: Young Leaders website","problem_id":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":null,"assignee_name":"Lars Bortfeldt","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692462}]
