This is a technical task, but should be fairly easy for anyone with basic technical knowledge to do, please let me know if you woudl like some more detailed instructions on this; it may make sense to add them to any 'emergency plan' you have.\r\n\r\nii) An emergency site, in case of well, emergencies. I guess the two things you are covering here are \r\n\r\na) the facility to have ready / put up a simple site in case of a major issue or news story and you just want all attention focused on that and not the site as a whole \r\n\r\nb) an issue with networks etc. and you just want a site you can edit by hand [it should be noted you can already edit 99% of the site by hand as it is all HTML/PHP on the live severs].\r\n\r\nIf you create a small site within /temporary/pages/html/ (or any other directory) we can write up some notes for you on how we would \r\n\r\na) switch to it and\r\nb) how you could edit it on the live servers directly if need be.\r\n\r\nThe third thing you may want is a copy of that emergency site synced to a server *outside* of the main server environment, this is something I haven't covered in this ticket but may be worth considering.  \r\n\r\nSo the things not covered in this ticket (which you may want to open a separate ticket for, but may want to discuss first) are:\r\n\r\n- documentation on switching to maintenance mode for 3rd parties (above what is described above, this will have a technical element) \r\n- documentation on switching to an emergency site for 3rd parties (above what is described above, this will have a technical element) \r\n- editing of the emergency site direct on the live server and how to sync content to the rest of the farm (familiarity with HTML and FTP will be required as will access the the servers, you may need to decide who and how people get access to the live servers to make sure we don't breach any security implications)\r\n- synchronization of emergency site to a 3rd party server (it may be that you want this server outside of BT's network to cover all eventualities)\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nSwitching to a temp page for maintenance, this is commented otu in .htaccess at the root of the site\r\n\r\n# -- TEMPORARY / MAINTINANCE

Is it OK that all text just display without any layout, ie. \nelements just list one after?\n\nIt may be that you decide that it might make more sense to tackle the \nhigh vis by taking the 'dyslexic' style sheet (which does seem to work \nin most places) and just change the colour of it? Or (given a possibly \nhigh cost) of retrospectively creating the perfect high viz style \nsheet you may want to query with Ability.net if this is the best \napproach / use of budget and if times have moved on and people now \nadjust stuff like this in their own browsers.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/05/07 17:05:18 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"First, let’s get the overlapping images sorted on the homepage.\n\n\nSecond, ‘I'm not even clear myself what the high-vis style sheet /should/ look\nlike.
