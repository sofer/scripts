So not sure where the \"Apparently it's not secure\" comes from?\r\n\r\nAlthough I do agree that if the service isn't being used much and you\r\nwould rather play it safe (and obviously the less points of attack the\r\nbetter) then it may be sensible to remove it completely.\r\n\r\nHowever this does leave the question of what goes in the place of it?\r\n\r\nShould we just move the Share on Regit/Digg/Stumble links up the 3rd\r\ncolumn and leave the rest of the space on the right empty of now?\r\n\r\nObviously there is going to be a small amount of work (1-2 hrs) involved in re-coding that markup / CSS / republishing pages etc. (and as far as I am aware what is there at the moment is not inherently insecure, although as I said I do understand why you may prefer not to have it as a possible point of attack if it's not really used) never the less I think we probably will have to charge for  time spend removing it or re-jigging the CSS/markup.\r\n\r\nLet us know if your happy to go with the suggestion above of dropping the email box and moving the digg/stumble links up to a 3rd column.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nJamie ","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/04/06 18:09:58 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Ah, sorry Jamie - I hadn't realised Morag sent this through!\n\n \n\nBut yes, I think that moving the digg/reddit/stumbleupon to the third\ncolumn is the best option! \n\n \n\nThanks,\n\n \n\nLiz\n\n \n\nLiz Goulding\n\nNew Media Producer\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\n\nDirect line: +44 (0) 203 2012 297\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nwww.london2012.com  \n\nwww.twitter.com/london2012 \n\n________________________________\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3709935},{"created_at":"2010/04/07 10:55:35 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Liz, can you please have a quick look at http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/index.php to see if it's all right to publish?","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":4323506},{"created_at":"2010/04/07 11:11:04 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Looks good\n\n \n\nLiz Goulding\n\nNew Media Producer\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\n\nDirect line: +44 (0) 203 2012 297\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nwww.london2012.com  \n\nwww.twitter.com/london2012 \n\n________________________________\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3709935},{"created_at":"2010/04/07 14:49:58 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Published.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":4323506},{"created_at":"2010/04/07 14:51:20 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Thank you!\n\n \n\nLiz Goulding\n\nNew Media Producer\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\n\nDirect line: +44 (0) 203 2012 297\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nwww.london2012.com  \n\nwww.twitter.com/london2012 \n\n________________________________\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3709935}],"linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":4,"status_updated_at":"2010/06/07 18:55:34 +0100","solved_at":"2010/04/07 15:57:18 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/04/06 18:03:12 +0100","channel":null,"via_id":4,"subject":"Can we please remove the 'share this page via EMAIL' from the share this page tool?","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"submitter_id":3709935,"base_score":0,"latest_recipients":"support+id798@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":"2010/04/13 12:00:00 +0100","current_collaborators":null,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/04/06 17:44:16 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/06 17:44:16 +0100","ticket_id":9930154,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/04/06 18:03:12 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/26 11:46:15 +0100","ticket_id":9930154,"value":".3"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/04/06 17:44:16 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/06 18:03:12 +0100","ticket_id":9930154,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/04/06 17:44:16 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/06 18:03:12 +0100","ticket_id":9930154,"value":"billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/04/06 17:44:16 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/14 11:55:32 +0100","ticket_id":9930154,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/04/06 18:03:12 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/26 11:46:15 +0100","ticket_id":9930154,"value":".3"}],"status_id":4,"description":"Apparently it's not secure.
