But when you go to the basketball Olympic sport page the image is of the old CGI (it's a subtle difference but the cladding is different).  I do not know how to change this image as I have already updated the image in the Venues page in CMS and i was led to believe this should update the image on the basketball sport page.\n\nSame for Hockey - I have updated the Venue page with the new CGI but i don't see how to change the sport page?\n\nHope that makes sense and i'm not just being a massive idiot!\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJustin.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":28776823},{"created_at":"2011/03/31 13:04:51 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi Justin\r\n\r\nI have altered the order the venues are pulled back in to be Alphabetical, this fixes the issue on the Basketball page, but there is no reason to think this ordering will work on other sports, in fact we may even find pages that previously had the correct order now have the wrong order.\r\nhttp://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/games/olympic-sports/basketball.php \r\n\r\nObvious as it may seem at a high level, technically it's not easy to change that component so that the venues appear in the same order as they are entered into the meta data tab/field.\r\n\r\nI am closing this ticket, and have opened a new ticket here with a more specific title, but it is very unlikely we will have this resolved this week.\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603}],"linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":4,"status_updated_at":"2011/05/19 10:17:37 +0100","solved_at":"2011/03/31 13:11:33 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/03/30 10:55:18 +0100","channel":null,"via_id":4,"subject":"Query re.
