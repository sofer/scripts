It's two part job:\r\n\r\n1. On the left side, a list of thumbnails of fans/members. There are two solutions for this, one is putting in an iframe with the facebook widget (same as what we're seeing on the vancouver site), which doesn't look very nice, but -very- easy to implement, so easy it's already installed on preview. The other solution would be to query the facebook API and generate a markup based on that. Based on the research, it's much harder than expected (there doesn't seem to be a way to get the list of fans of a page, which would be essential for this one - so we'd need to hack something, which may have a questionable reliability), probably a week or more.\r\n\r\n2. on the right side, there's a social wall - I'm not sure if it's decided yet wether we put facebook page wall or twitter feed to it, but both should be relatively straightforward as we did both in the young leaders page - just some css/alignment work here. But: we need to know which one to put in.\r\n\r\nAnd to make this progress really quickly, we need to know the url of the Facebook page we're integrating.

(or staging.) as it will now become the first in the chain.\r\n- Access to this server is only allowed to specific IP addresses (it is not part of the load balanced servers) *\r\n- CMS publication is stopped\r\n- The rsync scripts are moved from web01 to web00 (staging)\r\n- We manually sync web01 to web00 (so that web00 has a full copy of the site)\r\n- CMS publication is changed so that we now publish to web00 (staging)\r\n\r\nWe can then decide which content is automatically synced from web00 (staging) to web01-06; we can either stop any automatic syncing ie. when making a major site change, syncing of a section of a site (for launching a new section **) or just limit the auto syncing of CSS/JS (which we sync manually)\r\n\r\nDoes that sound similar to how you we're imaging it being used?\r\n\r\n* we already have the 'direct access' to web01 which we access via SSH to 213.120.228.198 (rather than going via the load balancer 213.120.228.200) / yes we need root (or ss -) access, although we currently have this on on web01 / in effect we need a clone of web01 / the same access rights (server and firewall) as we have to web01\r\n\r\n** although we can limit the automatic syncing of a given section or pages ie. /get-involved/volunteering we cannot stop pages outside of this section (which have been synced) from trying to link to new pages within this section. For example if we have a new page called /get-involved/volunteering/new.php then until we push that page out onto the live site, links to that page from pages outside of the /get-involved/volunteering section will result in a 404. We may be able to limit this using redirects. I think we probably need to look at this on a case by case basis, depending on exactly what we are trying to deploy.\r\n\r\n* These are the machines / routers / IP's that currently have access to web01 (we need the same level of firewall access to the new server)\r\n94.193.102.181 (kitsite office router)\r\n89.187.66.118 (milo.kitsite.com)\r\n89.187.66.113 (dev.kitsite.com)\r\n89.187.66.117 (koala.kitsite.com)\r\n89.187.66.120 (roo.kitsite.com)\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\nOn 26 May 2010, at 17:47, Jagdeep Bhambra wrote:\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\nI’m working with BT to scope out the Staging environment – this will also be used to host the volunteering site (which I believe you’re working on).\r\n\r\nCould you let me know the following:\r\na)       How is the site structured – html, PhP, flash?

Please find the press release below with more details.\n\nRegards\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[cid:image001.jpg@01CAFC1D.11810640]\n\n\n[cid:image002.jpg@01CAFC1D.11810640]\n\n\n25 May 2010\n\n\nMedia Release\n\n\n\n\nLondon 2012 confirm ArcelorMittal as tier two supporter\n\n\n\n\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) is pleased to officially confirm ArcelorMittal as a Tier Two sponsor of London 2012 and Official Steel Supporter of the Games. The deal follows confirmation that ArcelorMittal will fund the construction of a 115m high visitor attraction in the Olympic Park in time for the Games, which will be designed by artist Anish Kapoor and structural engineer Cecil Balmond and named 'The Orbit' during Games time.\n\nAs part of the deal, LOCOG will benefit from the sale of tickets to visit the viewing platform of the tower around the Games, as well as being able to provide hospitality in the tower at Games-time. The tower is expected to be completed by May 2012 and will be an iconic presence on the skyline as well as providing visitors with spectacular views across the Olympic Park.\n\nLOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe commented, \"The Olympic Games and Paralympic Games are already transforming east London and the addition of the Tower at Games-time will provide an added dimension to the Park. We are thrilled to have ArcelorMittal on board as a sponsor and I have great pleasure in welcoming them to the London 2012 family.\"\n\nLakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO of Arcelormittal, said: \"With the Games being the world's biggest sporting event, we felt that London 2012 was the perfect sponsorship opportunity.  We're excited about being associated with this great global sporting event and being able to showcase the versatility of steel at it with the ArcelorMittal Orbit.\" He added, \"I'm also personally pleased to be able to give a little something back with this initiative to London, which has been my home for many years.\"\n\nThe Orbit will stand in the southern part of the Olympic Park between the Stadium and Aquatics Centre. After completion, the Olympic Park Legacy Company will take ownership and run the tower.\n\n\n- Ends -\n\n\n\nFor further information please contact the London 2012 Press Office on +44 (0)203 2012 100 or visit the website at www.london2012.com.

Please find the press release below with more details.\n\nRegards\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[cid:image001.jpg@01CAFC1D.11810640]\n\n\n[cid:image002.jpg@01CAFC1D.11810640]\n\n\n25 May 2010\n\n\nMedia Release\n\n\n\n\nLondon 2012 confirm ArcelorMittal as tier two supporter\n\n\n\n\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) is pleased to officially confirm ArcelorMittal as a Tier Two sponsor of London 2012 and Official Steel Supporter of the Games. The deal follows confirmation that ArcelorMittal will fund the construction of a 115m high visitor attraction in the Olympic Park in time for the Games, which will be designed by artist Anish Kapoor and structural engineer Cecil Balmond and named 'The Orbit' during Games time.\n\nAs part of the deal, LOCOG will benefit from the sale of tickets to visit the viewing platform of the tower around the Games, as well as being able to provide hospitality in the tower at Games-time. The tower is expected to be completed by May 2012 and will be an iconic presence on the skyline as well as providing visitors with spectacular views across the Olympic Park.\n\nLOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe commented, \"The Olympic Games and Paralympic Games are already transforming east London and the addition of the Tower at Games-time will provide an added dimension to the Park. We are thrilled to have ArcelorMittal on board as a sponsor and I have great pleasure in welcoming them to the London 2012 family.\"\n\nLakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO of Arcelormittal, said: \"With the Games being the world's biggest sporting event, we felt that London 2012 was the perfect sponsorship opportunity.  We're excited about being associated with this great global sporting event and being able to showcase the versatility of steel at it with the ArcelorMittal Orbit.\" He added, \"I'm also personally pleased to be able to give a little something back with this initiative to London, which has been my home for many years.\"\n\nThe Orbit will stand in the southern part of the Olympic Park between the Stadium and Aquatics Centre. After completion, the Olympic Park Legacy Company will take ownership and run the tower.\n\n\n- Ends -\n\n\n\nFor further information please contact the London 2012 Press Office on +44 (0)203 2012 100 or visit the website at www.london2012.com.

So thanks!\r\nHowever I still have a couple more questions. They're fairly simple, but I just want to double-check before going ahead and updating all of the metadata (some of the updates are \"destructive\" - i.e. we're effectively discarding information, so I want to get it right!!).\r\n\r\nYou've only explicitly mentioned \"themes\" above. But I just want to double \r\ncheck that this applies to the other metadata types, too. Specifically:\r\n locations (East London,West,All,Greenwich,Hackney,Newham,Tower Hamlets,Walthamstow)\r\n venues    (Greenwich Arena,Paralympic Tennis and archery)\r\nAlso, can you just confirm that theme:Technology is should undergo this action. \r\nI ask, because it doesn't explicitly say \"Remove\" in the spreadsheet (but it IS\r\nin amongst the other \"Removed\" values). \r\n\r\n\"All locations\". The spreadsheet implies that location:All should be moved to\r\nthe \"freetext\" tags. However, I don't think you really mean that hundreds of pages\r\nshould be tagged to \"All\". I'm guessing you want such pages to be tagged to \r\n\"All locations\", rather than simply \"All\". Am I correct?\r\n\r\nSo the three questions are:\r\n1) Should the \"removed\" venues and locations be put into \"freetext\" tags.\r\n2) Is theme:Technology a removed theme?\r\n3) Should \"location:All\" be moved to \"freetext:All\", or \"freetext:All locations\", or maybe even \"location:All locations\".\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKieran\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/05/17 16:12:51 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"internal note: This might go above 2 days, as I've had to go through the spreadsheet line by line, and cross-check with what's in the db.

They were never 'treated' any differently by being 'locations' so we might as well just leave them as key words, and then we can include other areas as well. \r\n-- I can't remember - does the doc suggest getting rid of locations? I can't remember.  If so then freetext:UK-wide and freetext: Host boroughs(I think that's in the doc somewhere), otherwise, location:UK-wide etc. is cool.\r\n-- It's never the Greenwich arena, it's the North Greenwich arena.

We’re definitely going to need you and your wonderful help!\r\n \r\n1.       The splash page we are creating will be as light weight as possible.  It won’t have top nav (and probably won’t need our footer, either).\r\n\r\n2.       The splash page has a video on it (hosted by BigButton), text, and probably 2 pictures.\r\n\r\n3.       The splash page will live at london2012.com/mascots.  The splash page will ALSO sit in front of the homepage for a few days.\r\n\r\n4.

As soon as it has aired, we want it to go live ASAP.\r\n\r\n5.       Huw is looking to get this page onto Akamai\r\n\r\n6.       In order to cater for the people who come to our site before the splash has had time to propagate, we propose having a SplashB, with only text on it (Something to the effect of ‘Come back to meet our mascots after the One Show’).  This could be pushed live earlier in the day, so all we would need to do is replace the SplashB with the real splash when the time is right.\r\n\r\n7.       The switchover is around 7:30pm.  Because of all the unknowns around traffic, we will definitely need you to be around that evening, and probably on call during the night just in case.  We might need to get into the splash page to switch the video from being on BigButton to Youtube if traffic gets too high.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe main splash html should be ready for Friday.

Huw is looking to get this page onto Akamai\r\n\r\nCool\r\n\r\nbtw. 100% sure how Akamai expect this to work, I assume something like this, maybe Huw could pin someone down at Akamai who is to the point / no nonsense/ hands on sort of person to just check we're all on the same page.\r\n\r\n1) Mascot page does up here, password restricted till launch.\r\n\r\n/mascot/index.html\r\n\r\n2) We replicate this across all servers,  password restricted till launch.\r\n\r\n3)  We may also need to check with Akami if we need to add an extra ESI tags in? [as we have no personalised stuff on that page / assuming no login link, we won't need this]\r\n\r\n4) At launch we remove any password restrictions and add in a redirect form the homepage to /mascot/index.html\r\n\r\nAkamai then cache the first request for this page.\r\n\r\nThis does mean we will still be serving a redirect for every request (much lighter than a page, but still a request/response)\r\n\r\nAlthough I assume Akami will also still make a lightweight request/response to the live servers to check the page hasn't changed / is still cacheable anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n> 6.

This could be pushed live earlier in the day, so all we would need to do is replace the SplashB with the real splash when the time is right.\r\n\r\nIn terms of propagation, how long before Akamai pick up changes? As I understood it if you make a request you ISP checks the Akamai cache [which in turn may be synced with other Akamai caches] and if it's there it uses it else it request a copy and caches it for the next user.\r\n\r\nIf not then yes we could take the approach above, although that may be slightly tricker than a redirect (replacing a page in the CMS can be trickier than it may at first seem, using redirects is far quicker/simpler)\r\n\r\n\r\n> 7.       The switchover is around 7:30pm.\r\n\r\nCan you push to do it before the end of the program, seems will to launch at the exact moment of a spike (ie. people turning off their TV)\r\n\r\nBecause of all the unknowns around traffic, we will definitely need you to be around that evening, and probably on call during the night just in case.
