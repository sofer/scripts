Terri/Kavita not sure who is going to do this, is it just going to be someone in the ODA/LOCOG editorial teams who is currently using the CMS? If you have the text and are fairly sure it won't change, we can add it in for you, but if it's liable to be tweaked a few times before launch it may be better to take control of it yourselves and edit it in the CMS.\n\n2)  Questions page / template\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/questions.php\n\nnotes:\n* we have just taken the text supplied by LIDA 'QA Matrix.xls' let me know if you need any amendments made as we'll need to make them in the code.\n\n3)  The Answers page / template (normally you'll only get to here from the question page above)\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/results.php?q1=Yes&q2=Yes&q3=Yes&q4=Yes&q5=Yes&q6=Yes&q9=Yes&q11=Yes&q13=Yes&q14=Yes&q22=Yes&q20=Yes\n\nnotes:\n* the header text can be edited in the CMS (see above or let us have the correct text)\n** the popup text for the sign up box will need to be made by us (could you supply the text)\n** any changes to the questions will need to be made by us (for now I have left in the number of each answers to aid testing, these will be removed before going live). If possible could we try and bunch up any changes, rather than lots of incremental changes (obviously if we are showing the wrong answers or a issue is immediately obvious, we'll try to fix it right away before it progress to further round of testing).\n\n4) The PDF download link (from the results page, you wouldn't normally access this direct)\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/download-pdf.php?q1=Yes&q2=Yes&q3=Yes&q4=Yes&q5=Yes&q6=Yes&q9=Yes&q11=Yes&q13=Yes&q14=Yes&q20=Yes&q22=Yes\n\nnotes:\n* we still need the correct cover for this PDF, preferably A4 (or we can omit it completely which may also speed up the processing of it slightly) for now we have used a dummy cover page.\n\n5) Other things\n\n- Signup link, we are working on some changes here (with the actual / main signup process + registration system) as a separate piece of work due to be completed this week on our development server (although it won't make it to staging server this week due to the current LOCOG/IT code freeze, we will move it across as soon as the freeze is lifted).\n- Bookmark link: we only spotted this at the last minute and are unsure how this functionality was to work as many newer browsers don't support this functionality via a \"in page link\" for security reasons and no client side code was supply to handle this.

Terri/Kavita not sure who is going to do this, is it just going to be someone in the ODA/LOCOG editorial teams who is currently using the CMS? If you have the text and are fairly sure it won't change, we can add it in for you, but if it's liable to be tweaked a few times before launch it may be better to take control of it yourselves and edit it in the CMS.\n\n2)  Questions page / template\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/questions.php\n\nnotes:\n* we have just taken the text supplied by LIDA 'QA Matrix.xls' let me know if you need any amendments made as we'll need to make them in the code.\n\n3)  The Answers page / template (normally you'll only get to here from the question page above)\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/results.php?q1=Yes&q2=Yes&q3=Yes&q4=Yes&q5=Yes&q6=Yes&q9=Yes&q11=Yes&q13=Yes&q14=Yes&q22=Yes&q20=Yes\n\nnotes:\n* the header text can be edited in the CMS (see above or let us have the correct text)\n** the popup text for the sign up box will need to be made by us (could you supply the text)\n** any changes to the questions will need to be made by us (for now I have left in the number of each answers to aid testing, these will be removed before going live). If possible could we try and bunch up any changes, rather than lots of incremental changes (obviously if we are showing the wrong answers or a issue is immediately obvious, we'll try to fix it right away before it progress to further round of testing).\n\n4) The PDF download link (from the results page, you wouldn't normally access this direct)\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/download-pdf.php?q1=Yes&q2=Yes&q3=Yes&q4=Yes&q5=Yes&q6=Yes&q9=Yes&q11=Yes&q13=Yes&q14=Yes&q20=Yes&q22=Yes\n\nnotes:\n* we still need the correct cover for this PDF, preferably A4 (or we can omit it completely which may also speed up the processing of it slightly) for now we have used a dummy cover page.\n\n5) Other things\n\n- Signup link, we are working on some changes here (with the actual / main signup process + registration system) as a separate piece of work due to be completed this week on our development server (although it won't make it to staging server this week due to the current LOCOG/IT code freeze, we will move it across as soon as the freeze is lifted).\n- Bookmark link: we only spotted this at the last minute and are unsure how this functionality was to work as many newer browsers don't support this functionality via a \"in page link\" for security reasons and no client side code was supply to handle this.

On the surface it seems trivial, but firstly because those components are all core and shared across the site we need to be particular careful about adding in any conditional logic and testing it (ie. hide a search box, turn off email this page etc.). Secondly all our paths in the pages are root relative and rely on a base href tag, which means all IMG paths and HREF's will also need to be rewritten on the fly [probably via post processing we can't publish them with a full path with a http://domain]. There is also a third and even more complex issue of images in the Javascript and CSS files (which are currently static and cached by Akamai) being relative, these would also need a degree of post processing (which in the case a Javascript could be particularly tricky).\n\nI have already broken down the steps involved, it may be that you will be happy referencing the CSS files off the server with relative paths and letting your 3rd party developers do the post processing on them.\n\nMy concern here (with a tight turnaround) is that we are particularly likely to hit issues as we go along (in the past few days while we have been thinking about it we have though of several issues that weren't immediately obvious, some outlined above).\n\nAnyway, I'll outline what we see as involved and timescales and you can see if that will fit in with what your timings or if you think a halfway house may be a suitable approach, ie. we delivery the includes but some of the paths may need some manual cleanup in this first instance (later on we can feed what had to be cleanup manually back into the main includes outputter system when we have more time).\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/04/15 11:04:45 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Urgent.

The Twofour technical team have made changes to the player so it can be embedded at various sizes so we have two options for resizing to approx. 700px:\n\na)      If all embedded versions that you will use are the same size: TwoFour an change the MediaFreedom embed code generator so it generates all the embed codes in the larger size from now on.\n\nb)      If we need different sizes in different places, you can manually edit the width and height properties in the generated embed code as you need to.\nI imagine option b) is our preferred one given that the size of the player in News/Blogs/Other templates is going to be 448px as currently. Can you advise so I can instruct TwoFour - then you can adapt the video template to accommodate a larger player.\n\n\n4.       Re: your comment on making the player caption function more elegant, Jamie suggested a piece of work which might make the captions update the page when displayed (effectively removing the white bar). I'm happy to follow this up with TwoFour but could you provide more information about how this would work?\n\n\n5.       Do you have an update on making the home page lighbox/carousel work using the multi-programme view of the video?\n\n\n6.       Plus the outstanding bug with videos being deleted from the CMS when we make a change to them in MF, which you are already investigating.\n\nPhew - quite a lot there! Just wanted to capture all those points before I forget them! Let me know your thoughts when you have had time to consider.\n\nThanks!\n\nMorag\n\nMorag Reavley\nNew Media Manager\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\n1 Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon\nDirect dial: 020 32012 160\nReception: 020 32012 000","problem_id":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":null,"assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692462},{"nice_id":3877,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/05/05 14:01:02 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0.1","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/05/05 13:33:33 +0100","score":15,"resolution_time":98,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"bill_separately its level_0 none_required tested","assignee_id":3690996,"updated_at":"2011/06/07 09:14:36 +0100","req_name":"Finn Concannon","comments":[{"created_at":"2011/05/05 13:33:33 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"FYI - London Prepares Series Google code as promised.

These will just feed into the back-end, they don't want them up on the public-facing events pages.  Could you please give a quick quote and a time estimate?  Really ASAP would be great,\n\nLiz\n\nFrom: Roli Barker\nSent: 15 March 2011 14:19\nTo: Liz Goulding\nCc: Zara Rabinowicz\nSubject: Open Weekend reg page\n\nHi Liz,\n\nThe reg page looks great! But I have just noticed that there are some questions that are missing. This is entirely my fault, it wasn't on the example that was sent to you and I did not double check.\n\nAnyway...it's the things that we need for reporting purposes. I appreciate this is going to cost and isn't a priority but if they could update the reg form as soon as possible (it could be added in the internal use section) that would be great.\n\nThanks\nRoli\n\n\n\n\n*         Organisation Type\n\nCommunity or Voluntary Group\n\nLocal Authority\n\nNDPB (Non-Departmental Public Body)\n\nRegistered Charity\n\nSchool or

If there's a leading \"www\" then it is stripped (yielding, e.g. \"cartanglobal.co.nz\").\r\n3.

It can be static by sport but different sports are going to have different International Federations and sponsors.\n\nOne of the ideas that we had when planning this was that you could make the footer element containing the sponsors an image space in the same manner that you have done with the event title.
