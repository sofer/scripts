If we have alt text on the images (and we do), those who need alt text for navigation, will see it. There's a slight confusion w/ implementation in older versions of Internet Explorer (it confuses tooltips/title tags with alt text). Here's what the specification says:\r\n\r\n\"The alt attribute specifies alternate text that is rendered when the image cannot be displayed (see below for information on how to specify alternate text ). User agents must render alternate text when they cannot support images, they cannot support a certain image type or when they are configured not to display images.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200604/alt_text_is_an_alternative_not_a_tooltip/","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":4323506},{"created_at":"2010/10/05 14:32:30 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hmm, I’m still not sure here.

The title text, which in this case is associated not with the image but with the link is being used as a call to action associated with that link.\r\n\r\nLooking again at the BBC home page, some links have the title text on the link and some don't, cf. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11455144\" class=\"heroImageLink\">\r\n\t\t<img src=\"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/49335000/jpg/_49335317_m3301734-shoulder_injury-spl-1.jpg\" alt=\"Woman with shoulder injury\" width=\"100\" height=\"75\">\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n(in case you get a chance to look at this while it's still up, it's the \"Weird & Wonderful\" link in the central column)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, back to london2012.com, we do not currently add title tags to links and we do not by default add title tags to images either--although we do in some cases. See for example http://www.london2012.com/photos/search.php, where we have added  the title tag to the image (although not, as in the case of the BBC home page, to the link):\r\n\r\n<img src=\"transform/3089551/sc90x63/b-side.jpg\" title=\"Sound Tube ring out on Chesil Beach in Portland\" alt=\"Sound Tube ring out on Chesil Beach in Portland\">\r\n\r\nHere, we appear to have added a title tag and just copied the text of the alt tag. however, this is not something that we have done for all images.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the alt tag is an accessibility requirement, while the title tag is a convenience to all users, but I don't believe it is a requirement from an accessibility point of view. \r\n\r\nWe have already added the title tag (using the text of the alt tag) in some contexts, but not in all. We could probably add it elsewhere, if needed, although some work would be required to investigate where it was needed and to add the necessary code.\r\n\r\nI think that's clear in my head now (thanks to Janos), I hope it's a bit clearer to you as well :-)\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/10/07 12:51:17 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Happy to close this – thanks for your explanation!\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462}],"linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2011/01/05 13:16:48 +0000","solved_at":"2010/10/07 13:37:45 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"capped","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/09/29 10:46:20 +0100","channel":null,"via_id":0,"subject":"Alt text in london2012.com","recipient":null,"organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"submitter_id":3692462,"base_score":0,"latest_recipients":"support+id1468@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/09/22 15:54:40 +0100","updated_at":"2010/09/22 15:54:40 +0100","ticket_id":20153354,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/09/22 17:07:29 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/07 13:37:44 +0100","ticket_id":20153354,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/09/22 15:54:40 +0100","updated_at":"2010/09/22 15:54:40 +0100","ticket_id":20153354,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/09/22 15:54:40 +0100","updated_at":"2010/09/29 11:37:31 +0100","ticket_id":20153354,"value":"capped"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/09/22 15:54:40 +0100","updated_at":"2010/09/22 15:54:40 +0100","ticket_id":20153354,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/09/22 17:07:29 +0100","updated_at":"2010/09/22 17:07:29 +0100","ticket_id":20153354,"value":null}],"status_id":4,"description":"I am consistently unable to view the alt text on images in our website whenever I view it in IE7.

A key highlight this year was the invitation to the public and other dancers to have a go at another dance tradition and for the youngest dancers to mix with the oldest. We were joined by young musicians from Budmouth College supported by the local folk dancing/morris community and a swarthy band of pirates as stewards. Next year, the event will be held on 24 September – so come on down to Weymouth and see that young dancers are having fun and safely holding the English traditional dance alive.
