I have the following\nideas:\n\n \n\n1) just add in a bunch more in the existing drop down. It will be\na bit messy, but probably the easiest\n\n2) create a second dropdown for 'open weekend' only events\n\n3) create a 'tag cloud' of all the types, rather than a drop down!\nWill be more visually pleasing/navigable and allow for little types that\nonly occur once or twice to be represented accordingly.\n\n \n\nALSO\n\n \n\nThey want a 'fill in another' button after the form is submitted.
