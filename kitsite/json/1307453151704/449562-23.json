As I understand it if a web server is down the Load Balancer won't send traffic to a dead server (so we should be fine), although I am not 100% confident of this (may be worth checking with BT). As the cert is tied to a domain name / the csr and the staging server is not currently setup as an exact clone of the live servers we can't properly test it on the staging environment first. This is just me being extra cautious rather than I problem I necessarily foresee. \r\n\r\nAlthough saying all the above it looks as if the Certificate that a public user see's isn't the one installed on the server but rather an Akamai certificate?

Still investigating. One suspect here is some JS (for example a image carousel) that loops though images inside a given <div> tag, by appending a filename to a set path ie. \"/image/location\" + \"image1.jpg\" if there is no image then the code will try to retrieve the folder alone. Obviously where we have written any JS code that has this issue we can fix it. But a lot of the JS on the site was supplied by CogApp / McCann as self contained libraries. Obviously we are trying to gather as much info here as possible as this seems the biggest source of 404's\r\n\r\nStatus: open, moved to new/seperate ticket\r\n\r\n2) /ntytwelve (fixed) this was a broken path to an externally hosted video pasted in buy the editorial team; it was missing the [ http://89.234.19.19/twe ] bit and so was looking for the file locally.
