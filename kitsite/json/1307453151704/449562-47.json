On some pages, such as Aquatics\n<http://www.london2012.com/games/olympic-sports/aquatics-swimming.php> ,\nthe top right-hand box has all the venue details and an image but on\nother pages, such as Basketball\n<http://www.london2012.com/games/olympic-sports/basketball.php> , this\ninformation is missing.\n\n \n\nI reckon the easiest answer would be to drop the venue name into the\n'key facts' section of text on each sport, perhaps with a hyperlink back\nto that venue's page?\n\n \n\nHow does that sound? Let me know if you need the list or give me a bell\nif you've got a better idea.\n\n \n\nTa, Mark\n\n \n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n \nThis E-mail is confidential.
