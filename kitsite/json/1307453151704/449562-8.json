As far as I am aware this is not a recurring issue and if images are sent in the way Justin seems to be sending them then there shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIf there is a wider issue, then we need to trace though the images from Getty (checking how they are sent; as I said I don't know the correct way; I just know one way previously caused the XML to be sent without the JPG) though the FTP server and into the CMS.
