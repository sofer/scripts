This will \"ping\" the cms, telling it about each new/updated/deleted video. On the first run, it will notify the CMS of all current videos. This is a slightly redundant step but it will help with testing. Moving forward, whenever a video is created/updated/deleted in TwoFour, the CMS will be notified, and a Video page will be created/updated/(published)/delated.\r\n\t• (LOCOG) Moving forward, Blog & News articles can link to a video by linking to it (from the metadata pane).\r\n\r\nThe key 'next task' is:\r\n\r\n- Identify which videos you want to keep\r\n- Send these to TwoFour for encoding\r\n- Once video are in TwoFour assign the TwoFourID to the relevant Video page in the CMS\r\n\r\nThe above (largely) deals with 'legacy' video content.\r\n\r\nWe can then switch on the feed, from which point TwoFour and the CMS should be in sync.\r\n\r\nThe last task will be a clean up videos on Blogs and other pages not based on the Video template (going forward you'll assign a video by linking to the relevant video page in the CMS).\r\n\r\nWith regards to tagging, you can do it in both systems, although your right we'll have to decide where is best.\r\n\r\nIn regards to, creating a new video page, no that will be completely automated.\r\n\r\nBut lets chat tomorrow anyway, so that we're both clear on next steps / who needs to do what.\r\n\r\nps.

Are we confident that the Search feature in the video section will continue to work as previously?\r\n- In the absence of staging, how do we test that this has indeed worked without doing the switch on live - can we test on dev?  I am not clear what ITS will require by way of testing, but it will certainly be the ability to test thoroughly on dev - can this be arranged?\r\n- We need to update the home page so that the tiny video window in the Video tab is replaced by either a static promo or a clickable image which launches a lightbox showing the view of the video pane with related video thumbnails around it.

It still seems too small (448 x 307px) and has a white bar at the bottom of it? We have space for a 700px player (I'll resend my previous email about this separately) The video quality also looks terrible, has it been re-encoded?\r\nhttp://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/test/twofour-test.php\r\n\r\nThe new Flash video player is pulled in from MediaFeedom so it's something they should just be able to update at their end, Although we would need to set the correct height / width in the code that loads the player.\r\nhttp://players.mediafreedom.twofourdigital.net/swf/player.swf\r\n\r\nIf we need to change the player please allow us a morning to do this, although that shouldn't hold up launching (in effect the launch is a rolling launch, see below).\r\n\r\n- Feeds\r\n\r\nOnce that is done TwoFour will need to switch on their API which poll us of new or updated videos (this can't happen until you have entered all the video ID or else well end up with duplicate). \r\n\r\nWhen they pol us we then make a call back to their server to get more information about that video and wither create new page or update an existing one.\r\n\r\nWe have everything ready at our end to receive the API calls, but it's been a while since we tested it.

Budget:  They think it ought to be less than 2 days (£1400), but given that we often ask for lots of tweaks/changes, they are uncomfortable committing to less than that.  So what I propose is a two day cap on the work, but they will actually charge us by the hour ... which could work out to being less than 1 day.  That is how the New Media team work with them on a retainer, so they are very much trustworthy (and I'll watch them).  So if you can ringfence the £1400 for the next week until they complete work, and then raise a PO for the actual amount, hopefully everyone will be happy.\n\n2.       Format: One way of keeping the budget down (it will be much easier for them) is a type of email where the logo comes in embedded as a 'linked image'.  To most users connected to the internet, the email will appear just as you've requested.  The only exception is that if someone downloads all their emails, then turns off their internet connection and tries to look at it, the image won't be there.  It's pretty unusual for people to do that - most people stay connected to the internet when reading their emails - but it is technically possible.  If you are ok with that, then I think we're much more likely to keep it to a day's work.\n\nLet me know if you're happy and I'll get them started!\n\nLiz\n\nP.S.
