We (maybe) need a message to appear, indicating that you should enter the date in \"yyyy/mm/dd\" or \"yyyy/mm/dd hh24:mi\" format. \r\n 1.2.

It would probably make sense to check for dates in the past, too.\r\n 1.3. If you decide that you /don't/ want to manually specify a date, you need to be able to get back to the original popdown (ask me if you don't know what I mean here).\r\n 1.4.

This box (as at around 22nd December) was still showing high utilisation (around 88% as per the position when this case was closed) and they have also identified high utilisation on App04. I am still a little unsighted on whether the management of the files that are taking up this space fall within the remit of BT/IPsoft to manage or whether they are indeed the responsibility of the application owners to manage/housekeep (i.e. via LOCOG).\n\nWould you be able to seek final confirmation from IPSoft as to the ownership and responsibility for the maintenance of the content that is consuming the majority of the space on these 2 boxes in order that I can address with LOCOG and ensure that they have any necessary processes in place to maintain disk space at a suitable level if this is required of them (and can also apply across the rest of the estate).\n\nIt would be useful to get a brief summary of the usage by directory (top 5 or 10 based on utilisation for example) and the ?assumed? owner of those directories if possible - as always, any assistance would be appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\nAndrew","channel":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"","assignee_name":null,"updated_by_type_id":1,"requester_id":16724782},{"score":0,"nice_id":2388,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/01/04 11:15:55 +0000","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/01/04 10:16:16 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/04 10:16:16 +0000","ticket_id":28903675,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/01/04 11:15:54 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/04 11:15:54 +0000","ticket_id":28903675,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/01/04 10:16:16 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/04 10:16:16 +0000","ticket_id":28903675,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/01/04 10:16:16 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/04 10:16:16 +0000","ticket_id":28903675,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/01/04 10:16:16 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/04 10:16:16 +0000","ticket_id":28903675,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/01/04 11:15:55 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/04 11:15:55 +0000","ticket_id":28903675,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/01/04 11:15:54 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/04 11:15:54 +0000","ticket_id":28903675,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/01/04 10:16:16 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/04 11:15:54 +0000","ticket_id":28903675,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/01/04 10:16:16 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/04 11:15:54 +0000","ticket_id":28903675,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/01/04 10:16:16 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/04 11:15:54 +0000","ticket_id":28903675,"value":"none_required"}],"field_97116":"0","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/01/04 10:16:16 +0000","comments":[{"created_at":"2011/01/04 10:16:16 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Happy New Year to you all\n\nJust to confirm that the LOCOG Christmas Change Freeze has now ended and changes can be made using the normal processes.\n\nBest regards for 2011.\n\nRuss\n\nFrom: Russ Ede\nSent: 10 December 2010 10:20\nTo: Coupe, Olli (MAN-MEW); Hine, Matt (MAN-MEW); Cooper, Brett (MAN-MEW); 'cameron.bennett@cimex.com'; 'support@cimex.com'; Danny Sofer; 'support@kitsite.com'; 'ben.priestman@cimex.com'; 'jordan.harper@cimex.com'; 'mike@stamen.com'\nSubject: Reminder - Christmas Change Freeze Friday 17 December 2010 - 00.00 till Monday 3 January - 2011 - 00.01\n\nHi there all - please note that LOCOG will be entering its change freeze period from midnight next Friday.\n\nThanks\n\nRuss\n\n\nRuss Ede\n\nInternet Technology Services\nDirect line:  +44 (0)30 2012 0204\nMobile: 07760 758933\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nOne Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\nlondon2012.com\n\n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email\n\n\n\nFrom: Jonathan Davis On Behalf Of IT LOCOG CAB\nSent: 06 December 2010 08:31\nTo: #LOCOG One Technology Team\nCc: Jo Symcox; Morag Reavley\nSubject: Reminder - Christmas Change Freeze Friday 17 December 2010 - 00.00 till Monday 3 January - 2011 - 00.01\n\nDear All\n\nPlease note the LOCOG Christmas change free will be place from Friday 17 December 2010 -23.59 till Monday 3 January - 2011 - 00.01.
