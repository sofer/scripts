Will Visit Britain pull it every time a page loads on their site or will they retrieve it once a day and cache it. I don't really care ;-) but I know ITS are sensitive about this sort of thing esp. as each request will be a hit on our search index as the results returned will have to be upcoming events.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/06/09 14:56:47 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Jamie, lots of useful info, ta.

Also I assume we'd only deliver upcoming events?\n\nIf Visit Britain are happy to accept the XML fields/format we use internally, then it's probably a couple of days work to create the web service to return the relevant events as XML and expose them via an API key.\n\nPast experience has shown that even the simplest feeds tends to have a bit of bedding in the first time it is used, hence why I think we'd need a couple of days to get it working.\n\nIt would be best to be clear what we are delivering in advance and get that signed off as constant back / forth and changes with regards to fields etc. will quickly drive the cost up. The simplest format is for us to deliver the XML feed in our own format using our own field names. Although it may be that Visit Britain would prefer it as an extended RSS feed with each field as optional meta data values.\n\nThe question to them is probably \"Are you OK pulling back a XML feed back of all upcoming events in 2012 internal format once a day via a web service and caching the results?\"\n\nre. picking it up once a day would be no issue at all, once an hour would be no issue, it's more if every request to Visit Britain's homepage caused a hit on 2012 that we may have issues. In fact a XML web service call would come direct from the CMS (which we host) and not from the live environment at all. The easiest thing would be for Visit Britain to just 'cache' a local copy each day and then render their local copy of the file/data.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/06/09 15:34:41 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Jagdeep,\n\nFinn is talking to Visit Britain about supplying them with a 'feed' of events.\n\nMy concern was them retrieving a (RSS style) feed 'real time' and then displaying it prominently on their site ie. the home page.

Also I assume we'd only deliver upcoming events?\n\nIf Visit Britain are happy to accept the XML fields/format we use internally, then it's probably a couple of days work to create the web service to return the relevant events as XML and expose them via an API key.\n\nPast experience has shown that even the simplest feeds tends to have a bit of bedding in the first time it is used, hence why I think we'd need a couple of days to get it working.\n\nIt would be best to be clear what we are delivering in advance and get that signed off as constant back / forth and changes with regards to fields etc. will quickly drive the cost up. The simplest format is for us to deliver the XML feed in our own format using our own field names. Although it may be that Visit Britain would prefer it as an extended RSS feed with each field as optional meta data values.\n\nThe question to them is probably \"Are you OK pulling back a XML feed back of all upcoming events in 2012 internal format once a day via a web service and caching the results?\"\n\nre. picking it up once a day would be no issue at all, once an hour would be no issue, it's more if every request to Visit Britain's homepage caused a hit on 2012 that we may have issues. In fact a XML web service call would come direct from the CMS (which we host) and not from the live environment at all. The easiest thing would be for Visit Britain to just 'cache' a local copy each day and then render their local copy of the file/data.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/06/15 11:45:09 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"I think somewhere in between?

But Visit Britain may need a 'clean' XML feed without blocks of markup wrapped in CDATA. CDATA is a simple way of sending over a block of 'stuff' there is no structure / validity to what is in that block, this may or may not be an issue depending on what they are doing with the feed.\n\n2) Do you think it's something you could do quickly?\n\nYes/No, any feed tends to take at least a day to write and another day to test, handover, bed in and answer questions on etc.\n\n3) Ideal delivery date would be Friday!\n\nWould be very tight, would need sign off today / to start on it tomorrow \n\nand may have to push back if we hit issues with Visit Britain ie. they have issues parsing it / need lots of hand holding.\n\nLet us know if you want us to get started, we could deliver a 'light' webservice endpoint that just returned the ID's of all events with a last modified date and another endpoint that returned each event.

He needs to find where that target lives - it's\ncertainly not on our server.  And once he finds it, they need to edit the\ncode as Peter prescribed, to avoid scrollbars and layout formatting issues.\"\n\nHope that helps.\n\nAlastair\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Liz Goulding [mailto:Liz.Goulding@london2012.com]\nSent: 10 June 2010 17:19\nTo: Alastair Taylor\nSubject: RE: [PostCMS support] Re: FW: ask.london2012.com issue\n\nIs it just the pop-up code needs replacing?
