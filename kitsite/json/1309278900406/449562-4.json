This is the image I have been sent- what's the image size for the template?\n\nCheers\nZara\n\nFrom: Caroline Hadfield\nSent: 11 May 2011 14:11\nTo: Zara Rabinowicz\nSubject: OW email header image for webpages\n\nHi Zara,\n\nFollowing our meeting, we are working on providing you with images/text. I'ma afraid I am unable to change the graphics on the email header - I tried but I don't have the correct program on the computer and Chris said the image was becoming stretched when he attempted it. But I have attached it in jpeg - hopefully the web designers can work with this.\n\nThankyou,\n\nCaroline\n\nCaroline Hadfield\n\nOpen Weekend Project Co-ordinator\nDirect line:  +44 (0)20 3 2012 728\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nOne Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\nlondon2012.comhttp://www.london2012.com/\n\n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

Can you advise what would be the best way of making contact if this was required?

You would need to substitute the page already in the Splash page folder called 'index spare', together with a different background image called 'bg spare.jpg'.
