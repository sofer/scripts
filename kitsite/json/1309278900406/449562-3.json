As it would be a far better route to integration with MediaManger that the current method of FTP server + XML files + matching up .jpg of filenames and then cleaning up the folder structure once file have been retrieved.\n\nThese are our two most recent contacts at Getty.\nPatrick Stewart <patrick.stewart@gettyimages.com>\nSamuel Melo <Samuel.Melo@gettyimages.com>\n\nJamie\n\n1) Top level / date folders\n\nWhen an image is sent form Getty Media Manager to the the FTP server (btw this is a KS managed server) a date stamped folder is created with the following format /2011-006-15T11_04_24Z/ \n \n\n \n \n2) Each image individual delivery and sample XML\n\nFor each image an .xml file is sent along with a corresponding .jpg image, both will be stored in the current day's folder.\n\n10525_ODA_MDA_DT_119_HI.JPG.xml\n110525_ODA_MDA_DT_119_HI.jpg \n\n3) XML file format \n\nAn example file is attached:\n\n\n\n<gyi:value name=\"CMS Title\">The Basketball Arena&apos;s coloured seats represent a basketball</gyi:value>\n<gyi:value name=\"CMS image caption\">Construction is complete on the Basketball Arena.

Here are some screenshots to illustrate:\n \n* Note: the filename in the XML file (IIRC) [ <gyi:value name=\"Filename\">110525_ODA_MDA_DT_119_HI.JPG</gyi:value> ] does not take into account the sequence number in brackets nor the case of the .jpg extension (in the XML it is represented as .JPG but on the filesystem it is .jpg).\n\n- Delivery 1\n \n\n \n \n- Delivery 2\n \n\n \n \n- Delivery 3","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/06/20 11:27:19 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Thanks, Jamie.

This itself is not a big problem, however if a user with one of the old values (e.g. \"Between 50 and 250 people\") returns to the site and goes to the edit-profile page. The \"businessSizeOfOrganisation\" select box can't find \"Between 50 and 250 people\" in the (new) list of valid options, and so NO value is selected in the select box. We are applying a fix to this issue now.\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/06/01 11:34:37 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Actually Kieran,\r\n \r\nI was quite clear with LOCOG that this would be the case, namely that new users would have to re-enter the size of their organisation as their was no 1-1 mapping.\r\n\r\nIn fact I am not sure how this is a bug, it's just asking you to fill in a field, you may have completed it before but because the fields have changes we need new info (if this field is compulsory) you just need to re-enter it, in fact surely if you are editing your profile you will have changed other fields as well already.\r\n\r\nIf this was limited to business I'm not sure this is a major issue (although migrating would be nice but without a 1-1 mapping it may not even be perfectly achievable, maybe I am being a bit hard here). \r\n\r\nHowever  Morag's comment \"It looks like ordinary sign ups are being asked for business data\" is a bit more telling, I wonder if this is a mix of the issue above coming to light due to the issue Danny saw this morning.\r\n\r\nie. you sign up as a new user, but because (due to the SSL issue?) you are already logged in it thinks you are a business user and then asks you to correct a business field, even though you think you are just signing up as a *new* normal user.\r\n\r\nWhat do we do?\r\n\r\n- SSL : until this is fixed I think we are going to have a whole rash of these issues (made extra hard to debug due to the SSL issue). I think Danny said BT/Russ has a solution though?\r\n\r\n- Migration : If you think we can migrate sensible, then maybe we should just propose to do that (doing it in the DB would be nicer).\r\n\r\n- Existing users being sent to the new user register page (rather than being sent back to the login screen with a nice message) : maybe this is working and we're just not seeing it because of the SSL issue. Although as we are refactoring the whole registration system we probably do need to be sensible how much time we spend on this vs developing new screens.\r\n\r\nAlthough saying all the above, Danny also just spotted the cause of the issue he was seeing, namely the business fields are only hidden in CSS so your autocomplete still tries to fill them out. I think I may have to look at actually hiding them in PHP today.","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/06/01 11:40:08 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"I think you're right that - in many ways - it is NOT actually a bug.\r\nAlthough, as far as usability is concerned, it is not made clear to the user that \"the values of the fields have changed, and so you need to go back and amend your business profile\".\r\n\r\nI have put in place the mapping that I suggested so that when \"existing users with an OLD value for businessSizeOfOrganisation\" return to the site, their businessSizeOfOrganisation field is silently migrated to one of the NEW values, according to the following mapping:\r\n\r\nLess than 10 people -> \"0-9\"\r\nBetween 10 and 50 people -> \"20-99\"\r\nBetween 50 and 250 people -> \"100-499\"\r\nOver 250 people -> \"500-999\"\r\n\r\nAs you say, this is arguably not really a bug but they probably won't see it as that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2011/06/01 11:42:56 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Done.
