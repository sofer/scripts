Does anyone know what the exact limit is?\n\nDawn\n\nDawn Bracken\n\nTrailblazer Volunteer, Nations & Regions\n\nOperations, Mail Point A9,\n\nDirect line: +44 (0) 203 2012 476 \nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\n\n22nd Floor, One Churchill Place\n\nLondon E14 5LN\n\n \n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000 \n\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 492 \n\n \n\nwww.london2012.com\n\n \n\nFind out what is going on at London 2012 HQ – http://blog.london2012.com\n\n \n\nPlease think before you print this email\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Deborah Elstein\nSent: Tue 13/04/2010 09:55\nTo: Liz Goulding; 'support@postcms.zendesk.com'; Dawn Bracken\nSubject: RE: West Midlands Web Page\n \nDon't worry, I think Dawn and I worked it out, thanks\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: Liz Goulding \nSent: 13 April 2010 09:11\nTo: Deborah Elstein; 'support@postcms.zendesk.com'; Dawn Bracken\nSubject: RE: West Midlands Web Page\n\n \n\nSorry - Debs or Dawn can you please explain exactly what you're trying to change, and where?
