In the women&apos;s competition, the circumference is 54 - 56cm.\n\nThe same thing is happening on the Modern Pentathlon pages.\nGreek philosopher Aristotle described competitors in the Pentathlon of the ancient Games as the most &apos;perfect sportsmen, because in their bodies strength and speed are combined in beautiful harmony'.\n\nI've managed to get rid of the majority of these cases, but I just can't get rid of these two whatever I do! Do you know what is causing these formatting errors, and how they can be fixed? It's getting pretty frustrating!\n\nThanks,\n\nMichael\n\nMichael Thorne\nContent Coordinator\nEditorial Services department\nDirect line:  +44 (0)20 3 2012 046\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nOne Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\nFax: +44 (0)20 7719 1308\nlondon2012.comhttp://www.london2012.com/\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

Terri/Kavita not sure who is going to do this, is it just going to be someone in the ODA/LOCOG editorial teams who is currently using the CMS? If you have the text and are fairly sure it won't change, we can add it in for you, but if it's liable to be tweaked a few times before launch it may be better to take control of it yourselves and edit it in the CMS.\n\n2)  Questions page / template\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/questions.php\n\nnotes:\n* we have just taken the text supplied by LIDA 'QA Matrix.xls' let me know if you need any amendments made as we'll need to make them in the code.\n\n3)  The Answers page / template (normally you'll only get to here from the question page above)\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/results.php?q1=Yes&q2=Yes&q3=Yes&q4=Yes&q5=Yes&q6=Yes&q9=Yes&q11=Yes&q13=Yes&q14=Yes&q22=Yes&q20=Yes\n\nnotes:\n* the header text can be edited in the CMS (see above or let us have the correct text)\n** the popup text for the sign up box will need to be made by us (could you supply the text)\n** any changes to the questions will need to be made by us (for now I have left in the number of each answers to aid testing, these will be removed before going live). If possible could we try and bunch up any changes, rather than lots of incremental changes (obviously if we are showing the wrong answers or a issue is immediately obvious, we'll try to fix it right away before it progress to further round of testing).\n\n4) The PDF download link (from the results page, you wouldn't normally access this direct)\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/download-pdf.php?q1=Yes&q2=Yes&q3=Yes&q4=Yes&q5=Yes&q6=Yes&q9=Yes&q11=Yes&q13=Yes&q14=Yes&q20=Yes&q22=Yes\n\nnotes:\n* we still need the correct cover for this PDF, preferably A4 (or we can omit it completely which may also speed up the processing of it slightly) for now we have used a dummy cover page.\n\n5) Other things\n\n- Signup link, we are working on some changes here (with the actual / main signup process + registration system) as a separate piece of work due to be completed this week on our development server (although it won't make it to staging server this week due to the current LOCOG/IT code freeze, we will move it across as soon as the freeze is lifted).\n- Bookmark link: we only spotted this at the last minute and are unsure how this functionality was to work as many newer browsers don't support this functionality via a \"in page link\" for security reasons and no client side code was supply to handle this. The user can of course bookmark tier results page via the bookmark tab in their browser and this will bring them back to their personalised answer page.\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

Terri/Kavita not sure who is going to do this, is it just going to be someone in the ODA/LOCOG editorial teams who is currently using the CMS? If you have the text and are fairly sure it won't change, we can add it in for you, but if it's liable to be tweaked a few times before launch it may be better to take control of it yourselves and edit it in the CMS.\n\n2)  Questions page / template\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/questions.php\n\nnotes:\n* we have just taken the text supplied by LIDA 'QA Matrix.xls' let me know if you need any amendments made as we'll need to make them in the code.\n\n3)  The Answers page / template (normally you'll only get to here from the question page above)\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/results.php?q1=Yes&q2=Yes&q3=Yes&q4=Yes&q5=Yes&q6=Yes&q9=Yes&q11=Yes&q13=Yes&q14=Yes&q22=Yes&q20=Yes\n\nnotes:\n* the header text can be edited in the CMS (see above or let us have the correct text)\n** the popup text for the sign up box will need to be made by us (could you supply the text)\n** any changes to the questions will need to be made by us (for now I have left in the number of each answers to aid testing, these will be removed before going live). If possible could we try and bunch up any changes, rather than lots of incremental changes (obviously if we are showing the wrong answers or a issue is immediately obvious, we'll try to fix it right away before it progress to further round of testing).\n\n4) The PDF download link (from the results page, you wouldn't normally access this direct)\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/download-pdf.php?q1=Yes&q2=Yes&q3=Yes&q4=Yes&q5=Yes&q6=Yes&q9=Yes&q11=Yes&q13=Yes&q14=Yes&q20=Yes&q22=Yes\n\nnotes:\n* we still need the correct cover for this PDF, preferably A4 (or we can omit it completely which may also speed up the processing of it slightly) for now we have used a dummy cover page.\n\n5) Other things\n\n- Signup link, we are working on some changes here (with the actual / main signup process + registration system) as a separate piece of work due to be completed this week on our development server (although it won't make it to staging server this week due to the current LOCOG/IT code freeze, we will move it across as soon as the freeze is lifted).\n- Bookmark link: we only spotted this at the last minute and are unsure how this functionality was to work as many newer browsers don't support this functionality via a \"in page link\" for security reasons and no client side code was supply to handle this. The user can of course bookmark tier results page via the bookmark tab in their browser and this will bring them back to their personalised answer page.\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.
