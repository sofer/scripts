I've tried moving them, rewriting them, rewriting the whole sentence and various other things, but to no avail.\n\nFor example, for Handball the sentence in CMS reads The ball must be made of pure leather and have a circumference of about 58 - 60cm in the men's competition. In the women's competition, the circumference is 54 - 56cm.\nHowever, when it reaches the live site it reads The ball must be made of pure leather and have a circumference of about 58 - 60cm in the men's competition. In the women&apos;s competition, the circumference is 54 - 56cm.\n\nThe same thing is happening on the Modern Pentathlon pages.\nGreek philosopher Aristotle described competitors in the Pentathlon of the ancient Games as the most &apos;perfect sportsmen, because in their bodies strength and speed are combined in beautiful harmony'.\n\nI've managed to get rid of the majority of these cases, but I just can't get rid of these two whatever I do! Do you know what is causing these formatting errors, and how they can be fixed? It's getting pretty frustrating!\n\nThanks,\n\nMichael\n\nMichael Thorne\nContent Coordinator\nEditorial Services department\nDirect line:  +44 (0)20 3 2012 046\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nOne Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\nFax: +44 (0)20 7719 1308\nlondon2012.comhttp://www.london2012.com/\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

Terri/Kavita not sure who is going to do this, is it just going to be someone in the ODA/LOCOG editorial teams who is currently using the CMS? If you have the text and are fairly sure it won't change, we can add it in for you, but if it's liable to be tweaked a few times before launch it may be better to take control of it yourselves and edit it in the CMS.\n\n2)  Questions page / template\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/questions.php\n\nnotes:\n* we have just taken the text supplied by LIDA 'QA Matrix.xls' let me know if you need any amendments made as we'll need to make them in the code.\n\n3)  The Answers page / template (normally you'll only get to here from the question page above)\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/results.php?q1=Yes&q2=Yes&q3=Yes&q4=Yes&q5=Yes&q6=Yes&q9=Yes&q11=Yes&q13=Yes&q14=Yes&q22=Yes&q20=Yes\n\nnotes:\n* the header text can be edited in the CMS (see above or let us have the correct text)\n** the popup text for the sign up box will need to be made by us (could you supply the text)\n** any changes to the questions will need to be made by us (for now I have left in the number of each answers to aid testing, these will be removed before going live). If possible could we try and bunch up any changes, rather than lots of incremental changes (obviously if we are showing the wrong answers or a issue is immediately obvious, we'll try to fix it right away before it progress to further round of testing).\n\n4) The PDF download link (from the results page, you wouldn't normally access this direct)\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/download-pdf.php?q1=Yes&q2=Yes&q3=Yes&q4=Yes&q5=Yes&q6=Yes&q9=Yes&q11=Yes&q13=Yes&q14=Yes&q20=Yes&q22=Yes\n\nnotes:\n* we still need the correct cover for this PDF, preferably A4 (or we can omit it completely which may also speed up the processing of it slightly) for now we have used a dummy cover page.\n\n5) Other things\n\n- Signup link, we are working on some changes here (with the actual / main signup process + registration system) as a separate piece of work due to be completed this week on our development server (although it won't make it to staging server this week due to the current LOCOG/IT code freeze, we will move it across as soon as the freeze is lifted).\n- Bookmark link: we only spotted this at the last minute and are unsure how this functionality was to work as many newer browsers don't support this functionality via a \"in page link\" for security reasons and no client side code was supply to handle this. The user can of course bookmark tier results page via the bookmark tab in their browser and this will bring them back to their personalised answer page.\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

Terri/Kavita not sure who is going to do this, is it just going to be someone in the ODA/LOCOG editorial teams who is currently using the CMS? If you have the text and are fairly sure it won't change, we can add it in for you, but if it's liable to be tweaked a few times before launch it may be better to take control of it yourselves and edit it in the CMS.\n\n2)  Questions page / template\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/questions.php\n\nnotes:\n* we have just taken the text supplied by LIDA 'QA Matrix.xls' let me know if you need any amendments made as we'll need to make them in the code.\n\n3)  The Answers page / template (normally you'll only get to here from the question page above)\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/results.php?q1=Yes&q2=Yes&q3=Yes&q4=Yes&q5=Yes&q6=Yes&q9=Yes&q11=Yes&q13=Yes&q14=Yes&q22=Yes&q20=Yes\n\nnotes:\n* the header text can be edited in the CMS (see above or let us have the correct text)\n** the popup text for the sign up box will need to be made by us (could you supply the text)\n** any changes to the questions will need to be made by us (for now I have left in the number of each answers to aid testing, these will be removed before going live). If possible could we try and bunch up any changes, rather than lots of incremental changes (obviously if we are showing the wrong answers or a issue is immediately obvious, we'll try to fix it right away before it progress to further round of testing).\n\n4) The PDF download link (from the results page, you wouldn't normally access this direct)\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/make-your-plan/download-pdf.php?q1=Yes&q2=Yes&q3=Yes&q4=Yes&q5=Yes&q6=Yes&q9=Yes&q11=Yes&q13=Yes&q14=Yes&q20=Yes&q22=Yes\n\nnotes:\n* we still need the correct cover for this PDF, preferably A4 (or we can omit it completely which may also speed up the processing of it slightly) for now we have used a dummy cover page.\n\n5) Other things\n\n- Signup link, we are working on some changes here (with the actual / main signup process + registration system) as a separate piece of work due to be completed this week on our development server (although it won't make it to staging server this week due to the current LOCOG/IT code freeze, we will move it across as soon as the freeze is lifted).\n- Bookmark link: we only spotted this at the last minute and are unsure how this functionality was to work as many newer browsers don't support this functionality via a \"in page link\" for security reasons and no client side code was supply to handle this. The user can of course bookmark tier results page via the bookmark tab in their browser and this will bring them back to their personalised answer page.\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

On the surface it seems trivial, but firstly because those components are all core and shared across the site we need to be particular careful about adding in any conditional logic and testing it (ie. hide a search box, turn off email this page etc.). Secondly all our paths in the pages are root relative and rely on a base href tag, which means all IMG paths and HREF's will also need to be rewritten on the fly [probably via post processing we can't publish them with a full path with a http://domain]. There is also a third and even more complex issue of images in the Javascript and CSS files (which are currently static and cached by Akamai) being relative, these would also need a degree of post processing (which in the case a Javascript could be particularly tricky).\n\nI have already broken down the steps involved, it may be that you will be happy referencing the CSS files off the server with relative paths and letting your 3rd party developers do the post processing on them.\n\nMy concern here (with a tight turnaround) is that we are particularly likely to hit issues as we go along (in the past few days while we have been thinking about it we have though of several issues that weren't immediately obvious, some outlined above).\n\nAnyway, I'll outline what we see as involved and timescales and you can see if that will fit in with what your timings or if you think a halfway house may be a suitable approach, ie. we delivery the includes but some of the paths may need some manual cleanup in this first instance (later on we can feed what had to be cleanup manually back into the main includes outputter system when we have more time).\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/04/15 11:04:45 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Urgent.

Is this possible?\n\nThe ideal solution here would be for for TwoFour to add a 'don't send to CMS' flag to the videos in MediaFreedom and then for them to not poll us with those videos.\n\nIf they shouldn't be in the CMS then the most sensible / safest / cleanest thing is for TwoFour not to send them to us.\n\nThe problem with us checking things like channels is that we'll have to check the video to find out that it shouldn't have been sent to us, in fact I am not sure we can see the channel via the existing API call we are using so we may have to make an extra API call for every video.\n\nMorag -> following up\nKitsite -> awaiting further instructions\n\n> 3.
