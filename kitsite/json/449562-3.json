But I have just noticed that there are some questions that are missing. This is entirely my fault, it wasn't on the example that was sent to you and I did not double check.\n\nAnyway...it's the things that we need for reporting purposes. I appreciate this is going to cost and isn't a priority but if they could update the reg form as soon as possible (it could be added in the internal use section) that would be

It can be static by sport but different sports are going to have different International Federations and sponsors.\n\nOne of the ideas that we had when planning this was that you could make the footer element containing the sponsors an image space in the same manner that you have done with the event title.

Budget:  They think it ought to be less than 2 days (£1400), but given that we often ask for lots of tweaks/changes, they are uncomfortable committing to less than that.  So what I propose is a two day cap on the work, but they will actually charge us by the hour ... which could work out to being less than 1 day.  That is how the New Media team work with them on a retainer, so they are very much trustworthy (and I'll watch them).  So if you can ringfence the £1400 for the next week until they complete work, and then raise a PO for the actual amount, hopefully everyone will be happy.\r\n\r\n2.       Format: One way of keeping the budget down (it will be much easier for them) is a type of email where the logo comes in embedded as a 'linked image'.  To most users connected to the internet, the email will appear just as you've requested.  The only exception is that if someone downloads all their emails, then turns off their internet connection and tries to look at it, the image won't be there.  It's pretty unusual for people to do that - most people stay connected to the internet when reading their emails - but it is technically possible.  If you are ok with that, then I think we're much more likely to keep it to a day's work.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you're happy and I'll get them started!\r\n\r\nLiz\r\n\r\nP.S.  They're working on the export and 2010 events - it should be fixed today/tomorrow.\r\n\r\nLiz Goulding\r\nSenior New Media Producer\r\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\r\nDirect line: +44 (0) 203 2012 297\r\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\r\nwww.london2012.comhttp://www.london2012.com\r\nwww.twitter.com/london2012http://www.twitter.com/london2012","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/04/05 10:06:08 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hiya,\n\nCan I please get an estimate on when this work will be done?\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3709935},{"created_at":"2011/04/05 11:12:25 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"And further update to what they need:\n\nThe email we need is the longer one which includes all the details of the brand centre – the second email on page 2 of the document.
