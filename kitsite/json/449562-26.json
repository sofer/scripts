Will Visit Britain pull it every time a page loads on their site or will they retrieve it once a day and cache it.

Also I assume we'd only deliver upcoming events?\n\nIf Visit Britain are happy to accept the XML fields/format we use internally, then it's probably a couple of days work to create the web service to return the relevant events as XML and expose them via an API key.\n\nPast experience has shown that even the simplest feeds tends to have a bit of bedding in the first time it is used, hence why I think we'd need a couple of days to get it working.\n\nIt would be best to be clear what we are delivering in advance and get that signed off as constant back / forth and changes with regards to fields etc. will quickly drive the cost up. The simplest format is for us to deliver the XML feed in our own format using our own field names. Although it may be that Visit Britain would prefer it as an extended RSS feed with each field as optional meta data values.\n\nThe question to them is probably \"Are you OK pulling back a XML feed back of all upcoming events in 2012 internal format once a day via a web service and caching the results?\"\n\nre. picking it up once a day would be no issue at all, once an hour would be no issue, it's more if every request to Visit Britain's homepage caused a hit on 2012 that we may have issues. In fact a XML web service call would come direct from the CMS (which we host) and not from the live environment at all.

Also I assume we'd only deliver upcoming events?\n\nIf Visit Britain are happy to accept the XML fields/format we use internally, then it's probably a couple of days work to create the web service to return the relevant events as XML and expose them via an API key.\n\nPast experience has shown that even the simplest feeds tends to have a bit of bedding in the first time it is used, hence why I think we'd need a couple of days to get it working.\n\nIt would be best to be clear what we are delivering in advance and get that signed off as constant back / forth and changes with regards to fields etc. will quickly drive the cost up. The simplest format is for us to deliver the XML feed in our own format using our own field names. Although it may be that Visit Britain would prefer it as an extended RSS feed with each field as optional meta data values.\n\nThe question to them is probably \"Are you OK pulling back a XML feed back of all upcoming events in 2012 internal format once a day via a web service and caching the results?\"\n\nre. picking it up once a day would be no issue at all, once an hour would be no issue, it's more if every request to Visit Britain's homepage caused a hit on 2012 that we may have issues.

I think it may be something we would like to pursue - and quickly.  I was hoping to use the map (and the work Stamen had done) but their lack of response during my holiday has left it looking impossible to achieve for the listings go-live next week. (that said, could you look at this: http://data.map.london2012.com/points.php?format=atom&category=event&bbox=%2D23%2E6692%2C48%2E7894%2C15%2E0027%2C61%2E4261 and tell me how far off you think it is? I don't know how to check what information is actually in the feed - we'd want the date of the event, and event type, as well as title and short description)  Do you think it's something you could do quickly?  Ideal delivery date would be Friday!\n\nThanks!\n\nLiz\n\nLiz Goulding\nNew Media Producer\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\nDirect line: +44 (0) 203 2012 297\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\nwww.london2012.com\nwww.twitter.com/london2012","problem_id":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"0","assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3709935},{"nice_id":932,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/05/25 10:35:45 +0100","field_358835":"","field_110059":"","field_97116":".2","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/05/21 16:00:07 +0100","score":0,"resolution_time":617,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"billable its","assignee_id":4323506,"updated_at":"2010/09/14 10:16:45 +0100","req_name":"Liz Goulding","comments":[{"created_at":"2010/05/21 16:00:07 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Not sure if this is replicable - but could you have a look?\n\nFrom: Open Weekend\nSent: 21 May 2010 14:46\nTo: Liz Goulding\nSubject: FW: Open Weekend Registration\n\nAn example of an email from someone who hasn't been able to register.\n\nRuth\n\nRuth\nOpen Weekend Project Coordinator\n0203 2012 169\n\nFrom: Birrell, Helen - Health & Community [mailto:Helen.Birrell@halton.gov.uk]\nSent: 19 May 2010 15:55\nTo: Open Weekend\nSubject: Open Weekend Registration\n\nHi,\n\nI have tried a couple of times to register our 'Sports & Arts Academy' on the Open Weekend website, but once I have filled all the boxes in and clicked submit the page just disappears.\n\nCould you have a look and see if the event has registered or whether there is a fault please?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nHelen\n\nHelen Birrell\nAssistant Sports Development Officer\n\nHalton Borough Council\nRuncorn Town Hall\nHeath Road\nRuncorn\nWA7 5TD\n\nTel: 0151 906 1530\nFax: 0151 907 8355\nwww.halton.gov.uk/sportsdevelopment\nContact Sports Development for further information on 'Free Swimming' for under 16's & over 60's.\nAlso, there are still FREE places available on over 60's swimming lessons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Notice:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message is intended for the indicated addressees only and may be confidential.
