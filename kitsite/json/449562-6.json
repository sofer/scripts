I like the idea of taking my family along from the West Country for £60 (minus petrol and parking of course) but I cannot see at what age my children have to be before I have to pay full price (my kids are 13 and 17 yrs old) nor can I spot what I have to do to qualify for the 'D' or £20 tickets - or if I will need binoculars. The Olympic Games schedule is great but it doesn't tell me what 'AA' down to 'D' means......?\r\nThank you.","channel":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"0.25","assignee_name":"Kieran Topping","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692169},{"score":15,"nice_id":3107,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/03/15 11:45:27 +0000","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","ticket_id":37457826,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/03/15 11:45:27 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/16 11:54:16 +0000","ticket_id":37457826,"value":"0.15"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","ticket_id":37457826,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","updated_at":"2011/04/04 11:10:53 +0100","ticket_id":37457826,"value":"billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","ticket_id":37457826,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/03/15 11:45:27 +0000","updated_at":"2011/04/04 11:10:53 +0100","ticket_id":37457826,"value":"0.15"},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/03/15 11:45:27 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","ticket_id":37457826,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","ticket_id":37457826,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","ticket_id":37457826,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","ticket_id":37457826,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","ticket_id":37457826,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/15 12:14:19 +0000","ticket_id":37457826,"value":"0"}],"field_97116":"0.15","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/03/15 11:28:47 +0000","comments":[{"created_at":"2011/03/15 11:28:47 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"We have had the below email re: the 'apply now' button on our splash page.\n\nIs it possible to label the button correctly and investigate why this user (who is blind, and using a screen reader) can't access the site?\n\nIf you can't see a way around this, please can you let me know - I will refer this back to McCann who created the page.\n\nThanks!\n\nFrom: Robin Christopherson [mailto:robin.christopherson@abilitynet.org.uk]\nSent: 15 March 2011 11:20\nTo: Morag Reavley\nCc: Jon Gooday\nSubject: Unlabelled button on splash screen\n\nMorag\n\nJust a quickie to say that I see they have an unlabelled 'img/button' graphical link on the splash page which I suspect is the way of dismissing this splash screen and going to the home page.
