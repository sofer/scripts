If we put a summary line in a new field called 'strapline' it wont' be picked up anywhere.\r\n\r\nAt the moment we can just ignore it, but would be best to remove the strapline completely and make the OW team aware that the 'one sentence/strapline' is actually the description field in the CMS.\r\n\r\nLet me know if it is safe to remove the strap line.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\nps. if you look at the two fields in the attached screenshot you'll see that the two fields are being export separately, but this is a red herring, it's simply because the two fields both get populated with the same data when an event is submitted.
