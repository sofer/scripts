Would it be possible to enter an entry for each (ie. similar to how you have them listed by day). So that if someone selected a sport or venue it would return a list of events just for that sport/event; maybe grouped by date, unless the search contained a date in which case it would just return a list similar to the current 'by day' list. That would certainly simplify things. But would mean one entry per day/event in the back end (maybe that is the 600 events? in which case does each event only occur on one day at one venue?)\r\n\r\nSession: What is a session, is it an individual event on a individual day at an individual venue?\r\n\r\nIn terms of availability February is starting to look very busy for us, although saying that we are currently on top of workload and should have room to take this piece of work on, especially if we started now. But with the caveat that we'd need to be very firm on requirements / timescales. We probably won't have room to make lots of ad-hoc changes along the way.

You are correct that there would be up to 600 different event entries.\r\n\r\nSession: a session is a morning, afternoon or evening session for which a ticket is sold. It might contain a series of events (e.g. two heats and a semi-final) or in the case of Athletics a mixture of events (e.g. 100m heat, shot-put final, discus qualifying).\r\n\r\nFebruary: I appreciate that this month is going to be very, very busy, and that there wouldn't be time to make changes to the spec.

Some questions and comments:\n\nI think we do have a spreadsheet for an initial upload of 600 sessions – I think you said you could process a spreadsheet, but can you confirm?\n\nSport vs discipline – We only need to show the Sport field.\n\nWe also need to be able to indicate if a session has medals associated. This will be yes/no or true/false in the spreadsheet, but it would be good if we could indicate this graphically by means of a medal icon (we can provide this).\n\nTime – apparently it is not as straightforward as morning, afternoon, evening session, as some sessions straddle more than one time period ☹ Is it possible to make this field a time field with data such as ‘10.00 – 14.00’?\n\nThe field you have called ‘Extra information’ should be called ‘Session description’. This will need to accommodate information on more than one line i.e. with para returns e.g.\n‘Men’s Singles, Doubles: preliminaries\nWomen’s Singles, Doubles: preliminaries\nMixed Doubles: preliminaries’\n\nName – I am not sure what this field relates to. Could you change it to Session code – we would use this for the unique session code for each event e.g. ‘BD001’, ‘BD002’.\n\nCan we change the order the fields appear in so they run:\nSession code\nSport\nVenue\nDate\nTime of day\nSession details\n\nOtherwise this looks great to me.\n\nIf we need to go in and edit any records, how would we do so – will there be an interface where we can easily track down an individual session record to edit it?\n\nIn terms of designing the interface for search and results, is it possible to create a mock-up (or would you like me to do this – I could probably even get one designed by Cogapp except we only need something very simple). The template must also include promos for Tickets and for Prestige Ticketing in addition to the search/results interface.
