Part\ntwo isn't urgent.\n\n \n\nThanks\n\n \n\nAlex\n\nFrom: Alexandra Brown \nSent: 22 September 2009 15:29 \nTo: 'support@postcms.zendesk.com' \nCc: 'support@kitsite.com' \nSubject: Business suppliers - exporting data \n\nHi \n\nOn the Data --> suppliers dropdown in the CMS we are able to export the \nlist of suppliers as an excel spreadsheet but it is missing the 'sector'\n\nfield from this spreadsheet. \n\nPlease could someone allow the sector data to be included on the \nspreadsheet when it is exported? We need to look at this information \nurgently. \n\nThanks \n\nAlex \n\n \n\n\nFW: Business suppliers - exporting data\n\n\nCould we also make the 'sector' field in the data/suppliers form a \ndropdown or autofill text box as I think the people data inputting are \nputting different spellings. I presume it is this 'sector' field which \nis determining these pages? \n\nIt seems that all sorts of combinations are coming up because people are\n\nwriting the sector differently. \n\nAlex \n\n \n\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">This email message has been scanned for viruses by Mimecast.\nMimecast delivers a complete managed email solution from a single web based platform.\nFor more information please visit <a href=\"http://www.mimecast.com\">http://www.mimecast.com\n<hr width=\"100%\"></a>","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2009/10/13 10:18:32 +0100","updated_at":"2009/10/13 10:18:32 +0100","ticket_id":4300592,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":96134,"created_at":"2009/10/13 10:18:32 +0100","updated_at":"2009/10/13 10:18:32 +0100","ticket_id":4300592,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2009/10/13 14:11:23 +0100","updated_at":"2009/10/13 14:11:23 +0100","ticket_id":4300592,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":99758,"created_at":"2009/10/13 14:11:23 +0100","updated_at":"2009/10/13 14:11:23 +0100","ticket_id":4300592,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2009/10/13 10:18:32 +0100","updated_at":"2009/10/13 10:18:32 +0100","ticket_id":4300592,"value":""}],"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"","assignee_name":"Marna Gilligan","channel":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692354},{"nice_id":143,"initially_assigned_at":"2009/10/13 14:43:42 +0100","field_358835":"","field_110059":"","comments":[{"created_at":"2009/10/12 13:17:41 +0100","attachments":[{"size":160923,"created_at":"2009/10/12 13:17:41 +0100","content_type":"image/jpeg","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/helia00ttph5bat/?name=image001.jpg","token":"helia00ttph5bat","id":1710673,"filename":"image001.jpg","is_public":true}],"via_id":4,"value":"Are showing the words, 'open weekend'??
