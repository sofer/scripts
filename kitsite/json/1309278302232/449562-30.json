So if a post code were entered, finding events within a certain radius?\n\nIf you mean the CMS then that's a bit of a red herring, as the CMS only allows you to assign a postcode (or lat/long).\n\nI assume you mean can we add a postcode to the front end search, the answer is yes but it's not just a case of adding a postcode field to the form nor do we have some ready to use code to deploy out of the box.\n\nSome sites do this in a hacky way by /trying to/ (it's not accurate) stripping off the first bit of postcode entered up until a latter or space ie. 'N1 4DG' or 'N14DG' and then trying to match any postcode starting with those letters. That however doesn't deal with borders very well ie. N1 next to E8 \n\nThe proper way is to do it is to add a lat/long to every event, you get this for free if you use the location picker in the CMS but not from user submitted events. Then when someone does a search we also turn the postcode they entered into a lat/long coordinate and then for each result returned use a bit of maths to work out the distance between the two points and therefore whether it falls within an acceptable radius.\n\nThe short answer is no we don't have it and no we couldn't implement it this week.\n\nBut if it is a feature you want (and if your dealing with events it does obviously makes sense) we can look at implementing it\n\nAlthough it would almost certainly take the best part of a week to get up and running as we need to upgrade the search engine, write some wrapper code, update the search form, get the back end of the form to turn the postcode entered into a lat/long, assign lat/longs to all the legacy events, set it up so it does this automatically in future, test, deploy, test etc.\n\n> 2) Could we just show the postcode of the event next to the date it's occurring? Apparently people want to be able to tell at a glance if it's near them\n\n\nYou mean in the results? if so, certainly, mainly (*) just a case of deciding where it goes.\n\n* I think we also need to refresh/republish all the events as I don't think we currently store the postcode in the 'front end' search engine, so we would first need to add it as a indexable field and bulk update all the events so we can pull it back out when people do a search.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/06/22 16:52:46 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"1) For curiosity for future development, can you quote how long it would take?\n\n2) Yeah, that’s precisely what i mean.

I am wondering though if we can keep the section nav on the left hand side and get rid instead of the promos down the right hand column. That means people will be able to navigation out of the section and back to other Volunteering content.","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/07/01 18:06:27 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/01 18:06:27 +0100","ticket_id":14426350,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/07/02 16:57:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/02 16:57:17 +0100","ticket_id":14426350,"value":"0.2"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/07/01 18:06:27 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/01 18:06:27 +0100","ticket_id":14426350,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/07/01 18:06:27 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/05 14:04:52 +0100","ticket_id":14426350,"value":"bill_separately"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/07/01 18:06:27 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/01 18:06:27 +0100","ticket_id":14426350,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/07/02 16:57:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/02 16:57:17 +0100","ticket_id":14426350,"value":"0.2"}],"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"0.2","assignee_name":"Lars Bortfeldt","channel":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692462},{"nice_id":1043,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/07/01 17:13:57 +0100","field_358835":"","field_110059":"","comments":[{"created_at":"2010/06/29 18:38:21 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi Jamie\r\n\r\nFor our testing of the password-protected form on Monday, we are going to use a different url (one with an SSL certificate installed on it):\r\n\r\nAt your end you will need to change the urls from the password entry page through to the ATOS to these:\r\n\r\n1/ for specialists i.e. sitting behind the button “apply now” of the login & password page, the url should be\r\n\r\n=> https://esitraining.london2012.com/ESIREG/NewFormRequest.do?email=<CAPTURED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>&group=<VOLUNTEER_GROUP_NAME>\r\n\r\n2/ for the public i.e. sitting behind the “apply now” button on the volunteer website, the url should be\r\n\r\n=> https://esitraining.london2012.com/ESIREG/NewFormRequest.do?group=public\r\n\r\nIs it possible to do this in time for Monday please?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nMorag\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2010/07/01 17:13:57 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Changed..","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/07/01 17:55:36 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Working like a dream – thanks!\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2010/07/05 14:35:12 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Part of volunteering work.

But my guess is that is unworkable from a business point of view, esp. if you aren't sending the invites/pre-reg emails out.\r\n\r\nThe other option is obviously a Captcha, but wasn't the whole point of the Accessible form that it mustn't have a captcha?\r\n\r\nAnyway let us know if the form now works for you.\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/07/02 12:50:49 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Thanks for this explanation, Jamie.\n\nIt is working now, but I take your point that this is less secure.\n\nWe can’t IP restrict as there will be lots of people from the same organisation applying, as you rightly say.

I assume though that ATOS are logging the IP address of each application request so if this did happen (although TBH why would anyone bother?) it would be trivial to purge the rogue requests (plus I assume they would look fake).\n\nIn terms of a Denial of Service attack, I can think of a dozen better places to repeatedly hit on the site if we wanted to cause issues, this isn't one of them.\n\nThe most common cases where you need Captcha's are:\n\ni) Contact Us forms (ripe for abuse, ie. disgruntled person sending in 1000's of messages to clog up you CRM system) \nii) Signup forms on things like Email services where they want to stop people automating the creation of 1000's of accounts which in turn could be used to send Spam\niii) Send to a Friend style features where without a Captcha or other mechanism a spammer can use the feature to send emails via your servers [this is only really an issue if a message can also be added].\n\nIn short I ATOS probably have one to eliminate the off chance that someone tries to pump the backend full of fake requests, but as the Specialist Registration needs a password (and a hacker or script-kiddy) isn't goign to have that password I'd say it's a non-issue.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603}],"field_97116":"0.3","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/06/29 15:01:28 +0100","resolution_time":74,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"not_billable","assignee_id":3686603,"problem_id":null,"updated_at":"2010/09/30 17:16:14 +0100","req_name":"Morag Reavley","ticket_type_id":4,"status_updated_at":"2010/09/30 17:16:14 +0100","solved_at":"2010/07/02 16:54:12 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"not_billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/06/29 15:44:14 +0100","via_id":0,"subject":"Specialist group application form","recipient":null,"organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"score":0,"submitter_id":3692462,"base_score":0,"linkings":[],"latest_recipients":"support+idBYBP-7A89@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":"2010/07/02 12:00:00 +0100","current_collaborators":null,"status_id":4,"description":"The 'accessible form' checkbox doesn't seem to work.
