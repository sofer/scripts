THIS WORKS\r\nIn addition to an image (under 1MB) the user will be able to enter the following fields when\r\nsubmitting their image.\r\n• Name - WHERE IS THIS STORED?\r\n• Email - APPEARS TO BE OBTAINED FROM LOGIN AND PRESERVED AS \"OWNER\". IS THAT SUFFICIENT?\r\n• Description - APPEARS TO BRE STORED AS \"Caption\"\r\n• Title - APEARS TO BE STORED AS \"Alt\"\r\n��� Date photo taken - OK\r\n• Postcode (not geocode) - APPEARS NOT TO BE WORKING\r\n• Image (JPG < 1MB) - OK\r\n\r\nPost moderation images a page will be created for the image and published as per the\r\nworkflow for image arriving in the Getty feed. It will additionally be possible to add user\r\nsubmitted images to manually created galleries using the same mechanism that is cur-\r\nrently used to move images that have arrived from Getty.\r\n\r\nOK\r\n\r\nUser generated images will be tagged with the email address/name of the user uploading\r\nthe image so they can easily be identified en mass in future.\r\n\r\nCAN YOU CONFIRM HOW THIS IS BEING PRESERVED?\r\n\r\nIt is not clear whether a user has to be logged in first to upload an image, for the purpose\r\nof this document we will assume not.\r\n\r\nIT LOOKS LIKE THIS HAS CHANGED NOW, AS LOGIN IS NOW REQUIRED..\r\n\r\nDeliverables:\r\n• new template and form to allow users to upload image OK\r\n• back end moderation tool to allow images to be moderated - OK\r\n• Updating of exiting image template to allow name of user who uploaded the image to additionally be stored. - THIS LOOKS LIKE ITS BEEN OVERLOOKED\r\n• workﬂow and publication rules to resize, create pages for and publish user submitted images - LOOKS OK\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS:\r\nThe approval queue is a bit confusing as it is hard to tell what state an uploaded image is in. It would be very helpful if we had something like for blog comments.","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2009/08/14 08:37:17 +0100","updated_at":"2009/08/14 08:37:17 +0100","ticket_id":3142072,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":96134,"created_at":"2009/08/14 08:37:17 +0100","updated_at":"2009/08/14 08:39:47 +0100","ticket_id":3142072,"value":"test_feedback"},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2009/08/25 11:08:48 +0100","updated_at":"2009/08/25 11:08:48 +0100","ticket_id":3142072,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":99758,"created_at":"2009/08/25 11:08:48 +0100","updated_at":"2009/08/25 11:08:48 +0100","ticket_id":3142072,"value":"0"}],"organization_id":38711,"field_177410":"","assignee_name":"Lars Bortfeldt","channel":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3640926},{"nice_id":66,"initially_assigned_at":"2009/08/21 10:11:33 +0100","field_358835":"","field_110059":"","comments":[{"created_at":"2009/08/21 10:11:33 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"We've got some changes that we'd like made to the supermap template:\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.london2012.com/in-your-area/map/index.php\r\n\r\nWe've got a version of the HTML up here with the changes:\r\n\r\n\thttp://map.london2012.com/search_map/\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\n1) Including a link to jquery in the header:\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/jquery.js\"><\/script>\r\n\r\n2) Including a link to a javascript file that we control, which manages the SWF parameters and such:\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://map.london2012.com/search_map/search_map.js\"><\/script>\r\n\r\n3) Removing the <script>/<noscript> bits from the #supermap div, so that it looks like this:\r\n\r\n<div id=\"supermap\">\r\n\t<div id=\"video_alt\">\r\n\t\t<h2>Can't see the map?</h2>\r\n\t\t<p>The application requires <a href=\"http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/\">flash player version 9 or higher</a> and a JavaScript enabled browser.</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nRight now the map is a little bit squished because we've made the timeline taller and were unable to change the height in the template—hence the zoomed out UK.
