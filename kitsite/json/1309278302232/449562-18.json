Staging load-balancer\r\n\r\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com is currently live to the general internet.\r\n\r\n* ActionPoint 1. Although this is beyond my remit, I would advise retricting access in some way - either at an apache level, or at the akamai level, or at an o/s or hardware firewall level.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Staging servers: stage03/04\r\n\r\n2.1. Apache\r\n\r\nCurrently, stage03/04's Apaches do NOT use NameVirtualHost's.\r\n\r\nI recommend that we SHOULD use NameVirtualHost's. If Apache is set up differently to web01/04 then it introduces a whole class of error that cannot be caught by testing in the staging environment.\r\n\r\n* ActionPoint 2. Can stage03/04 have Apache set up to use NameVirtualHost's please? We currently only need one host set up: vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com.\r\n\r\n2. Rsync\r\n\r\nCurrently, stage03 is NOT synced with stage04.\r\n\r\n* ActionPoint 3.

Jag:\r\n\r\nHi all\r\nIt would be best to continue the work on the Staging servers once Jamie is back from holiday.  I think a lot of what has been asked may have already been implemented...\r\nWe can then schedule a conf call with BT/LOCOG/Kitsite.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n2. Kieran:\r\n\r\nI am up to speed with what has already been implemented. The requests that I have recently made are for further enhancements to the current environment.\r\nWe can - of course - wait until next week, however my concern is that the 3 or 4 substantial pieces of work that we are waiting to launch will now be further delayed. As I indicated before, this does not impact us, but will impact the editorial team adversely.\r\nI believe, for example, that a new ticketing promo is due to go live tomorrow, and a new splash page on Friday, regarding ticket pricing. I presume these are immovable deadlines (Danny, perhaps you could confirm?).\r\nPerhaps this might be a time to suggest (on the editorial team's behalf) dropping the requirement for all new work to go through the staging environment until such a time as we actually have an operational staging environment?\r\nKieran\r\n\r\n3. Jag:\r\n\r\nKeiran\r\nIt was discussed that the ticketing splash page can be done as usual – as was done for volunteering. So this should not be impacted.\r\nCould you let me know what additional pieces of work are scheduled?\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n4. Kieran:\r\n- Hide quoted text -\r\n\r\n* Chartbeat tags (work complete, but on hold)\r\n* Shop (work complete, but on hold)\r\n* Search bug: http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/1613 (fix ready, but on hold)\r\n* Change to ticket promo (changes launched in absence of staging)\r\n* Splash page. If you're just talking about the switching off/on of the splash page, then that's great that there's a process in place. If I'm to understand it correctly, though, the new splash page itself should be okayed on the staging server before going live?\r\n\r\nWe are very keen to ensure that we meet your staging requirements, but we're also very keen to push this current backlog live, and are thus happy to be advised - on a case-by-case basis - if certain projects can be launched without going through staging.\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/13 15:37:16 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Perhaps this ticket should be closed: http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/1537\r\n(and/or merged)","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/13 15:44:35 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"or vice versa :-)","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/10/13 15:46:00 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":19,"value":"Ticket #1537 \"Set up staging environment [was:...\" was closed and merged into this ticket.\r\n\r\nLast Comment in #1537: Status update: awaiting a conference call with BT","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/10/19 16:41:17 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Preparation and conf. call with Jag, today discussing forwarding our requirements for setting up apache to BT/IPSOFT.\r\nJamie 45min, Kieran 45min, Total 0.2\r\n\r\n(possibly more to come today, as Jag is sending a group email for annotation)","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/26 12:50:54 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Another email to Jag (as Jag didn't send his group email for annotation)\r\nKieran 45min (0.1)\r\nRunning total to follow...","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/26 12:54:40 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"1.5 Kieran: (Oct 4-8)\r\n0.1 Kieran: email Oct 11\r\n0.1 Kieran: email Oct 13\r\n0.2 Jamie,Kieran conf. call Oct 19\r\n0.1 Kieran: 26 Oct Another email to Jag.\r\n\r\nRUNNING TOTAL\r\n2.0 days\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/27 11:39:53 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"1.5 Kieran: (Oct 4-8)\r\n0.1 Kieran: email Oct 11\r\n0.1 Kieran: email Oct 13\r\n0.2 Jamie,Kieran conf. call Oct 19\r\n0.1 Kieran: 26 Oct Another email to Jag.\r\n0.2 Kieran: 27 Oct Another email to Jag / phone discussion w.

I.e. could we provide the app as a java applet, silverlight, flash etc?\r\n\r\nThe London 2012 web guidelines I think exclude Java applets and Silverlight.\r\n\r\nFlash is fine as long as we degrade gracefully, which in this case would mean a user would just see the webcam as an image.\r\n\r\n\t• If we hosted the app on our servers and you presented it in an <iframe> on your page, would that be ok?\r\n\r\nIf this was /just to provide the overlay/ I think this would be acceptable.\r\n\r\nBut it wouldn't be acceptable for the underlying static webcam image, firstly I think ODA/LOCOG would like all images to be served from their domain so that they get indexed in Google Image search with the correct domain, secondly from a usability perspective we try to avoid IFRAMES for any key content and finally lastly we need a copy of the latest image in the CMS / tied to a webcam page so we can pull a thumbnail of it into other pages such as the Venue pages based on related tags.\r\n\r\n I think that is all I can think of for now. Any details on how the current system works would help.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the functionality and how the Flash movie is loaded into the page as an overlay, have a look at this page.\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/webcams/velodrome.php\r\n\r\nIn terms of the images themselves we just retrieve a copy of the webcam from yourselves every 15 mins, hold it for 15mins (in case of a accident etc.) and then publish it out to the live site (sample url below). We don't keep an historical copies of the images on the live server.\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/transform/1965113/m700x/velodrome.jpg\r\n\r\nHopefully that answers a few questions, let us know if you need any more info..\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603}],"field_97116":"0.2","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/12/02 15:15:18 +0000","resolution_time":164,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"billable cms images level_0 none_required webcams","assignee_id":3686603,"problem_id":null,"updated_at":"2011/03/09 11:30:33 +0000","req_name":"Uzma.Khan","ticket_type_id":1,"status_updated_at":"2011/03/09 11:30:33 +0000","solved_at":"2010/12/09 11:10:54 +0000","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/12/02 15:16:08 +0000","via_id":0,"subject":"webcams watch progress over time......","recipient":null,"organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"score":0,"submitter_id":3686603,"base_score":0,"linkings":[],"latest_recipients":null,"due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"status_id":4,"description":"Hi Jamie\r\n \r\nAs you know, you carried out some work allowing us to turn on/off time-lapse function on the webcams, which is great feature for us to be able to use.\r\n \r\nHowever we would like to find a permanent solution allowing us to sort out issues with the current time-lapse on the webcams. which possibly  means we stop using Stamen to produce the time-lapse for the webcams  and start using Site-Eye as they hold all the images and there would be one less supplier in the chain.
