To get round this we'd need a add a new class to every templates used by culture based on the section and then override all the CSS styles that cause the header bars / text to be pink / blue (including rollover states and accessible versions).\n\nSo yes we could do it, but it's not like changing a couple of CSS styles or picking a different colour in Photoshop.\n\nWhen you say 'Pink header' are you referring to the bar that says 'The Games' ? I've make mocked this up in pink, see attached? and although I haven't fully though though what side effects this could have (ie. if we end up with pink headers on other pages by mistake!). This change is probably achievable by the 2st, the biggest amount of work here is probably making sure we don't' cause side effects (although we will also need to add a new class to all the templates in culture, add new styles, test that they don't cause bleed / side effects elsewhere and then republish everything. We may also need to use staging to make sure we don't end up with a mish-mash of pages with different colour bars in that section while we republish the pages).\n\nIn terms of \"header text for pink\" if you mean the dark grey text, you can sort of see the issues we'll hit here in the second screenshot (note breadcrumb and labels have also picked up the pink colour) that's not to say we couldn't work round this but it would be tricky to get this in place by the 21st.\n\nSo...\n\n- Yes to logo (if it will fit, 166 x 188px, we can't adjust padding or vertical / horizontal height for the 21st) --> 0.5 days\n- A reserved yes to the header --> 0.5 days (costly due to us having to update templates, separate out styles, testing, republish to staging etc. it's not just a single CSS change)\n- No to any other text (for the 21st)\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/06/10 14:47:36 +0100","attachments":[{"size":596093,"created_at":"2011/06/10 14:47:36 +0100","content_type":"image/png","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/5v836zgeeuhqx0o/?name=image001.png","token":"5v836zgeeuhqx0o","id":49391332,"filename":"image001.png","is_public":true}],"via_id":4,"value":"Thanks, Jamie.

It hard to give a firm answer till we try it, but if time is tight and we hit issues we may need to back out.\n\nI think the key thing here, which may not be obvious to the culture team is this isn't a case of modifying a blue print brochure to be pink in photoshop or indesign.

I am briefing this in to a designer – will aim to have this by first thing 22 June for implementation.\n\nBut given the volume and possible difficulties anticipated around the ticketing process, we need to be prepared to man the site over the following 48 hours too – the splash page will remain up for a few days.\n\nWhile any problems would most likely arise on the Ticketing site, we might need to:\nAmend the splash page at regular updates (we can probably do this by editing the html but if problems arise we might need support)\nKeep an eye on traffic volumes on our site in case they reach dangerous levels\nEnsure that functionality on our site continues to work given the high volumes\n\nWe would be very grateful if you could bear in mind this additional support level – obviously being

Basically while there team were investigating, it seemed that there was no embed code in the site at all.  This would have been generated from the CMS.  So something in the CMS must have removed it.  MediaFreedom was checked and it was all playing out fine, the API web services were working, etc, no issues there. Can you see if there was something happened on your side of things?\n\nOn a side note, can you ask your CMS team to send us a list of all MF API calls they are using, and when and why they are using them.

Basically while there team were investigating, it seemed that there was no embed code in the site at all.  This would have been generated from the CMS.  So something in the CMS must have removed it.  MediaFreedom was checked and it was all playing out fine, the API web services were working, etc, no issues there. Can you see if there was something happened on your side of things?\n\nOn a side note, can you ask your CMS team to send us a list of all MF API calls they are using, and when and why they are using them.  This is to ensure when we upgrade you there are no issues.\n\nThanks\n\nAndy\n\n\n\nFrom: Anna Rawles\nSent: 09 June 2011 12:09\nTo: Jonathon Lines\nCc: Andy Doyle\nSubject: RE: Problem with updating video file deleting content on our site\n\nOK, thanks, can you please let Eldon know that we will feedback on the issues for urgent resolution this afternoon.\n\n\n\nFrom: Jonathon Lines\nSent: 09 June 2011 12:00\nTo: Anna Rawles\nSubject: RE: Problem with updating video file deleting content on our site\n\nHi Anna\n\nI can't make the call I'm afraid.
