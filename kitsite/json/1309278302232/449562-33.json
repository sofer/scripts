He has registered 3 other events and they've all been fine but any time he tries to register this one the error message appears.  There's nothing immediately obvious to me as to why there is an error, can you look into it for me?\n\nThanks\nRuth\n\n\n\n[cid:image001.png@01CAEC55.423BC8B0]\n\n\n\n[cid:image002.png@01CAEC55.423BC8B0]\n\n\n\n\n[cid:image003.png@01CAEC55.423BC8B0]\nRuth Langford-Johnson\nOpen Weekend Project Coordinator\nCulture Team Assistant\nCulture, Ceremonies, Education & Livesites\nDirect line:  +44 (0)20 3 2012 169\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nOne Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\nlondon2012.com\n\n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

It's two part job:\r\n\r\n1. On the left side, a list of thumbnails of fans/members. There are two solutions for this, one is putting in an iframe with the facebook widget (same as what we're seeing on the vancouver site), which doesn't look very nice, but -very- easy to implement, so easy it's already installed on preview. The other solution would be to query the facebook API and generate a markup based on that. Based on the research, it's much harder than expected (there doesn't seem to be a way to get the list of fans of a page, which would be essential for this one - so we'd need to hack something, which may have a questionable reliability), probably a week or more.\r\n\r\n2. on the right side, there's a social wall - I'm not sure if it's decided yet wether we put facebook page wall or twitter feed to it, but both should be relatively straightforward as we did both in the young leaders page - just some css/alignment work here. But: we need to know which one to put in.\r\n\r\nAnd to make this progress really quickly, we need to know the url of the Facebook page we're integrating.

(or staging.) as it will now become the first in the chain.\r\n- Access to this server is only allowed to specific IP addresses (it is not part of the load balanced servers) *\r\n- CMS publication is stopped\r\n- The rsync scripts are moved from web01 to web00 (staging)\r\n- We manually sync web01 to web00 (so that web00 has a full copy of the site)\r\n- CMS publication is changed so that we now publish to web00 (staging)\r\n\r\nWe can then decide which content is automatically synced from web00 (staging) to web01-06; we can either stop any automatic syncing ie. when making a major site change, syncing of a section of a site (for launching a new section **) or just limit the auto syncing of CSS/JS (which we sync manually)\r\n\r\nDoes that sound similar to how you we're imaging it being used?\r\n\r\n* we already have the 'direct access' to web01 which we access via SSH to 213.120.228.198 (rather than going via the load balancer 213.120.228.200) / yes we need root (or ss -) access, although we currently have this on on web01 / in effect we need a clone of web01 / the same access rights (server and firewall) as we have to web01\r\n\r\n** although we can limit the automatic syncing of a given section or pages ie. /get-involved/volunteering we cannot stop pages outside of this section (which have been synced) from trying to link to new pages within this section. For example if we have a new page called /get-involved/volunteering/new.php then until we push that page out onto the live site, links to that page from pages outside of the /get-involved/volunteering section will result in a 404. We may be able to limit this using redirects.
