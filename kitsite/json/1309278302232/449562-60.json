haven't tried extensively to see if it still running, it should be, but then again we had assumed it was now deprecated so haven't actively done any testing against it.\r\nhttp://challenge.london2012.com/\r\n\r\nThe web server log files are available but are split over ~30 files on 4 separate servers so a total of 120 log files.\r\n\r\nWe could load them into a stats tool on a different server and try and run some reports against them, but obviously woudl take some time to set up (about half a day)\r\n\r\nThe pages are tracked by a google analytics account though with the ID UA-1925888-1\r\n\r\nNo sure if you can associate a domain with any google analytics account and then look at past history?\r\n\r\nWorth a try though, if you associate the challenge.london2012.com domain with your google account and then send me the verification file (the google gives you) I'll upload it or you coudl just send me the login details to your google account if that's easier.\r\n\r\nHope that helps\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"><\/script>\r\n<script
