This takes the form of an accessible / 'access now' form sitting on our main site, which will provide an accessible short form allowing users of screen readers and other vision impairment technology to submit an application. The application will be received by our Call Centre, who will call the person back and help them to submit the full application on the ATOS application form.\r\n\r\nThe intention is to provide an alternative to the actual application form (a system built by ATOS) which has some shortcomings from an accessibility point of view (particularly screenreaders).\r\n\r\nI attach a Powerpoint showing the core requirements for this form. It's pretty simple: the fields are itemised on page 4. The main requirement is that the coding is fully accessible, properly marked up etc. We would also want icons with tooltips to provide additional help - see the form laid out here (it is a mock-up of the ATOS form, but shows the icons with tooltips):  http://locog.metroserver.co.uk/ We would also ask AbilityNet to work closely with you in order to test the form and ensure it is watertight. We can also work with McCann to design up this page (if you think that preferable). \r\n\r\nIn terms of timings, this needs to be ready with the rest of the Volunteering site to be tested from 9 June, so it's not a huge amount of time.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like from you at this stage is a quote indicating as closely as you can the cost of doing this piece of work.

Plus testing, integration, tweaks etc. (the actual coding will probably  turn out to be the smallest part of the work, but the more parties involved the more these things tend to eat up time, hence why I have priced this a day more than we may normally have to cover tweaks, emails, questions, interrogation, panics :) etc. \r\n\r\nBut a couple of questions:\r\n\r\n- Will the form be largely based largely on the Atos one http://locog.metroserver.co.uk/ (but re-coded form scratch to deal with accessibility issues) \r\n\r\n- Will Ability.net supply the initial recommendations upfront? \r\n\r\n- Do we just need to send a single email to the call center (will the confirmation email and the rest of the sign-up be handled by the call center?)\r\n\r\n- Do you need an accessible Captcha? (I knwo that was the issue with original form so expect not). Therefore if we drop the Captcha, I assume you'd want us to limiting the registrations to one email (sent to the call center) per email address /  limit the number of uses by one machine/IP address.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/04/19 16:56:57 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi Morag,\r\n\r\nAs per our conversation:\r\n\r\n- Kitsite to build form based of look and feel of exiting form with input from Ability.net\r\n- Drop Captcha\r\n- Add in check for multiple request form the same address\r\n- Email to be send to both call center and user\r\n- Integration and testing\r\n\r\n6 days\r\n\r\nps. One thing I forgot to check is if it is OK for us to host the page and script that sends the emails / stores the submitted details on the www.london2012.com server/domain [but use the branding from the volunteer site]. The reason I suggest this is that is may be more complex / time consuming to host the form page on the ATOS' server and if we do it on the www. server we have full control.

This takes the form of an accessible / 'access now' form sitting on our main site, which will provide an accessible short form allowing users of screen readers and other vision impairment technology to submit an application. The application will be received by our Call Centre, who will call the person back and help them to submit the full application on the ATOS application form.\r\n\r\nThe intention is to provide an alternative to the actual application form (a system built by ATOS) which has some shortcomings from an accessibility point of view (particularly screenreaders).\r\n\r\nI attach a Powerpoint showing the core requirements for this form. It's pretty simple: the fields are itemised on page 4. The main requirement is that the coding is fully accessible, properly marked up etc. We would also want icons with tooltips to provide additional help - see the form laid out here (it is a mock-up of the ATOS form, but shows the icons with tooltips):  http://locog.metroserver.co.uk/ We would also ask AbilityNet to work closely with you in order to test the form and ensure it is watertight. We can also work with McCann to design up this page (if you think that preferable). \r\n\r\nIn terms of timings, this needs to be ready with the rest of the Volunteering site to be tested from 9 June, so it's not a huge amount of time.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like from you at this stage is a quote indicating as closely as you can the cost of doing this piece of work. Would it be possiblet to have something by close of play tomorrow?\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any questions or discuss further!

I'll expect you'll answer no, was \nhoping you could explain that...\n\n<content:select id=\"eventRegion\" title=\"Region\" isMetaData=\"true\" \ntaxonomy=\"regions\" />\n<content:string id=\"region\" title=\"Region\" taxonomy=\"regions\" \nisMetaData=\"true\"/>\n\n#SuggestedSolution#: Maybe we can just consolidate these into one \nfield? I assume both regions relate to the event not the organiser.\n\n2) We then have these three fields which seem to refer to the venue \nthe event is being held at, is the event location and venue location \nthe same thing?\n\n<content:string id=\"location\" title=\"Location\" taxonomy=\"locations\" \nisMetaData=\"true\"/>\n<content:string id=\"county\" title=\"County\" isMetaData=\"true\" />\n<content:string id=\"venueBorough\" title=\"Venue borough\" \nisMetaData=\"true\" taxonomy=\"boroughs\" />\n\n#Clarification#\n\n3) Once we have got to the bottom of the above there is the question \nof locations vs regions, regions just seem to be a subset of location.\n\nRegions: http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/_system/taxonomy/regions.xml\nLocation: http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/_system/taxonomy/locations.xml\n\n#Root cause#: I expect what happened here, is that at some point the \nOW team requested a bigger set of 'locations/regions' than the current \nregions.xml taxonomy contained. So Marna added them in but then those \nextra values showed up in *ALL* region meta-data inputs on the site or \nin the CMS. So she created a new taxonomy called locations.xml just \nfor the OW events.\n\n#Problem#: The problem there is that we have i) two inputs that \noverlap each other ii) a new field 'location' that won't get related \nto articles tagged by 'region'.\n\n#SuggestedSolution#:\n\nWe add the new fields to the region taxonomy and then live with the \nfact that those extra fields show up as options whenever region is \navailable in the CMS.\nWe can drop Region and keep Location, but nothing will relate by \nregion anymore.\nWe keep and consolidate down to Location (ie. a the wider region \ntaxonomy) and /try/ to be clever and always save off a value in a \nhidden Region field *if* the Location is contained in the region \ntaxonomy (this may end up be more trouble / problematic than it's worth)\n\n4) Back to the original question\n\nAfter we have covered the above, we can back to the original question, \nbut first a couple of questions:\n\n- Which 'region' field are we looking at?\n\nIf we do the above (3) then we will now a single 'location' or \n'region' field which relates to a) the event (which is the same as \nvenue?) b) the organiser's location - delete as appropriate.\n\n- We have county field further down, Is this related? Should the above \nfield sit above it? Is this the second field that is reduced when a \n'Region' (or Location is selected)\n\nIn terms of work, it looks like we actually need to do some clean up \nfirst.\n\nBut the actual implementation of the two pulldowns requires two things:\n\na) Turn both the region (or location) and country fields into pull \ndowns, which should be fairly easy (we need to do it on the OW form, \nthe event form and the CMS screen)\nb) Add in some Javascript functionality (and a config file) to tie the \ntwo fields together.\n\nIf we limit (b) to the frontend (not the CMS *) then it actually makes \nlife simpler, the only tricky thing is that because we already use the \nregion and county taxonomies in their current format elsewhere in the \nCMS we will have to upkeep a 3rd file which contains information about \nboth taxonomies and their nesting. As the region/country values are \nunlikely to change? this is probably isn't an issue, but in other \ncases / other fields it may be.\n\nAnyway I think I probably replied with more questions than answers, \nbut hopefully at the end we'll have a better Events system and I be \nable to more clearly tell you how long a two step pull down for Region/ \nCounty would take (**)\n\nThanks !\n\nJamie\n\n* the form used to edit Events in the CMS is a generic editor, it's \nnot a special interface just for editing events, therefore we can't \neasily add custom functionality, like a two step pull down. We could \nbuild a custom screen/interface for events but we'd be into the 3/4 \ndays or work area, so I won't even suggest it.\n\n** I expect it would be a days work (or just under) to get the pull \ndown working properly across both forms. But it looks like we will \nalso need to spend some time on some clean up / consolidation (will \nhave a better idea of the work involved here after we have discussed \nthe above)","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/04/21 09:35:25 +0100","attachments":[{"size":118715,"created_at":"2010/04/21 09:35:25 +0100","content_type":"image/jpeg","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/yp7j3jb5v7qst4n/?name=image001.jpg","token":"yp7j3jb5v7qst4n","id":4726673,"filename":"image001.jpg","is_public":true}],"via_id":4,"value":"Jamie,\n\n \n\nFirst of all - I warned them this might not be an easy piece of work!\nSo if it's more than one day, that's fine!\n\n \n\n1) I would love it if there was only one region field. There's always\nbeen two in the back end, and I've *never* understood why!\n\n2) Last year we were collecting information on both the event address\nand the venue address. That's clearly a silly thing to do, so this year\nwe're only collecting information on venue address - so the other is\nexcessive. As for the word 'location' see below.\n\n3) The meta-data on location is something we're actually looking to get\nrid of, if you check the ticket about updating the metadata - it's just\nnot something we really use, and would prefer to use free-text tags\ninstead. In general, though, the region should be a drop down box with\nthe 13 official Nations and Regions in it.\n\n \n\nI have to say the rest of your email confused me a bit. Do those\nanswers clear things up enough that you can re-propose a solution?\nWhat's probably MUCH more helpful is to look at the actual event form on\nthe front end - that's the information we actually want to be\ncollecting. The way these fields match up in the back-end has always\nconfused me a bit. Right now, we just have a drop down to select a\nregion. (see screen grab below) What we want adding is another drop\ndown box that is populated with counties dependent upon whichever region\nis selected.

Something way probably asked for and rather than push back and say \"we need to approach this requirement a different way\" Marna just took the literal route.\r\n\r\nAnyway Janos and myself spent afternoon discussing this, looking at what we had, how we could consolidate it.\r\n\r\nGood news !!!\r\n\r\nWe think we can collapse them all down to a single 'Region' (13 regions) field, some Locations had Borough but we can push then into the Borough field, I think we may have a dozen that need to be handled by hand.
