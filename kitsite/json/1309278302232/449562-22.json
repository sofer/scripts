This is to ensure we an audit trail, a communication channel to all relevant (and/or impacted) parties, and to ensure there is a contingency/rollback process in place.\n\nInclusion of Chartbeat involves a code change to the Live environment - hence this should come under change management.  As this process has yet to be formalised, the steps would be:\na) Kitsite make the code change on Staging\nb) Kitsite (and LOCOG) check this to ensure the code has not broken anything - New Media to confirm\nc) As Staging is a restricted environment and may not be accessible to Chartbeat*\nd) Assuming the code is fine, and we have confirmation, KitSite and/or LOCOG propose a time/date to deploy tested code on Live\ne) Email goes out to all concerned informing them of the change (including time/date)** - see below\nf) If there are no concerns, or all concerns are addressed, then the code can be deployed at the suggested time/date\ng) After deployment, KitSite performs a check on the site, and sends out an email confirming the status - eg, \"Deployment successful\"\nh) Chartbeat is checked to see if stats can be reported - New Media/ITS to confirm\n\n*Cannot say as I do not know how the code in Chartbeat works.

The title text, which in this case is associated not with the image but with the link is being used as a call to action associated with that link.\r\n\r\nLooking again at the BBC home page, some links have the title text on the link and some don't, cf. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11455144\" class=\"heroImageLink\">\r\n\t\t<img src=\"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/49335000/jpg/_49335317_m3301734-shoulder_injury-spl-1.jpg\" alt=\"Woman with shoulder injury\" width=\"100\" height=\"75\">\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n(in case you get a chance to look at this while it's still up, it's the \"Weird & Wonderful\" link in the central column)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, back to london2012.com, we do not currently add title tags to links and we do not by default add title tags to images either--although we do in some cases. See for example http://www.london2012.com/photos/search.php, where we have added  the title tag to the image (although not, as in the case of the BBC home page, to the link):\r\n\r\n<img src=\"transform/3089551/sc90x63/b-side.jpg\" title=\"Sound Tube ring out on Chesil Beach in Portland\" alt=\"Sound Tube ring out on Chesil Beach in Portland\">\r\n\r\nHere, we appear to have added a title tag and just copied the text of the alt tag. however, this is not something that we have done for all images.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the alt tag is an accessibility requirement, while the title tag is a convenience to all users, but I don't believe it is a requirement from an accessibility point of view. \r\n\r\nWe have already added the title tag (using the text of the alt tag) in some contexts, but not in all. We could probably add it elsewhere, if needed, although some work would be required to investigate where it was needed and to add the necessary code.\r\n\r\nI think that's clear in my head now (thanks to Janos), I hope it's a bit clearer to you as well :-)\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/10/07 12:51:17 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Happy to close this – thanks for your explanation!\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462}],"field_97116":"0","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/09/22 15:54:39 +0100","resolution_time":358,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"authorized capped","assignee_id":4323506,"problem_id":null,"updated_at":"2011/01/05 13:16:48 +0000","req_name":"Morag Reavley","ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2011/01/05 13:16:48 +0000","solved_at":"2010/10/07 13:37:45 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"capped","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/09/29 10:46:20 +0100","via_id":0,"subject":"Alt text in london2012.com","recipient":null,"organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"score":0,"submitter_id":3692462,"base_score":0,"linkings":[],"latest_recipients":"support+id1468@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"status_id":4,"description":"I am consistently unable to view the alt text on images in our website whenever I view it in IE7.

Teams from across the region aged 5-25 danced to the delight of the general public. A key highlight this year was the invitation to the public and other dancers to have a go at another dance tradition and for the youngest dancers to mix with the oldest. We were joined by young musicians from Budmouth College supported by the local folk dancing/morris community and a swarthy band of pirates as stewards. Next year, the event will be held on 24 September – so come on down to Weymouth and see that young dancers are having fun and safely holding the English traditional dance alive. This was the second year we have had fine weather – you may even go away with a tan!\n\n\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":12073254},{"created_at":"2010/09/30 15:42:51 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"OK.

priority and if you do spend time on this then we need to capture/charge for it).\r\n\r\nWe don't have a 'see related product link' so maybe make that 'see other products'\r\n\r\nThere is also a shop icon like the video and photo icons that should probably also go on this widget.\r\n\r\nThe product thumbnails I think come in different sizes, ie. they aren't all on a 220x160 background although we can constrain them to those width/heights.\r\n\r\nThe last job is to actually add this widget to the relevant templates (look at how we pull in videos/photos/events I think we may do this in the master template).\r\n\r\nThe widget needs to be an include as it will be loaded into each page and evaluated at delivery time.\r\n\r\nIt probably makes sense to sense to add the widget (when were near to going live) and hide it / only show it in preview (until launch).\r\n\r\nLars, keep track of you time on this as we'll probably add it onto the main Shop ticket / invoice.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/09/28 12:35:25 +0100","updated_at":"2010/09/28 12:35:25

Extract the \"30018010\" from the filename. (done)\r\n2. Lookup the product with id=30018010 (done)\r\n3. Retrieve $product[\"imageThumb\"] via http, and serve its contents, remembering the following:\r\n  i) Serve a correct Content-Type header (just copy it).\r\n ii) Serve a Content-Length header (it's good practise :-))\r\niii) Serve a header saying \"expires a log time in the future\" (thus akami will cache it for a long time).\r\n\r\nAny questions ... just ask.\r\n\r\nThis task is complete when a request for:\r\n  http://london2012dev.kitsite.com/shop/ecommera/30018010.jpg\r\ndisplays the following image:\r\n  http://demandware.edgesuite.net/sits_eu/image/AAEK_PRD/on/demandware.static/Sites-ldn-Site/Sites-london2012/default/v1285741963979/images/original/Olympic%20Pins/London%20Silhouettes/hondav_pins_monument_front_orig.jpg?sw=100&sh=100&shrp=2.0&q=75.0&sfrm=jpg\r\nPLUS a long expires header.\r\n\r\n(Note the reason we're doing this is that ecomera don't want to serve the images. Neither do we really, so ... lets just serve them with a LONG expires header, and push the problem on to akami).\r\n\r\n","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/09/29 17:00:35 +0100","updated_at":"2010/09/29 17:00:35 +0100","ticket_id":20696937,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/09/29 17:00:35 +0100","updated_at":"2010/09/30 14:09:38 +0100","ticket_id":20696937,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/09/29 17:00:35 +0100","updated_at":"2010/09/29 17:00:35 +0100","ticket_id":20696937,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/09/29 17:00:35 +0100","updated_at":"2010/09/29 17:00:35 +0100","ticket_id":20696937,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/09/29 17:00:35 +0100","updated_at":"2010/09/29 17:00:35 +0100","ticket_id":20696937,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/09/29 17:00:35 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/01 10:19:08 +0100","ticket_id":20696937,"value":"1"}],"organization_id":38711,"field_177410":"1","assignee_name":"Lars Bortfeldt","channel":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3663591}]
