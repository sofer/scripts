I can ask BT to check with regards to the testing, however, their testing team is currently busy on another project, and the adistars project will be their next port of call. Can KitSite be asked how they are pulling the products into our site (I can do this if you prefer) – depending on what solution they are implementing we may be able to get away with this without BT having to do long strenuous testing...”\n\nCan you provide an answer to Jag’s question above re: how the products are being pulled in?
