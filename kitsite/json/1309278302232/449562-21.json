This need not be a permanent fix (although in the longer term it would be nice to have this information) - I am looking for being able to pull out all the records we have in the five Olympic host boroughs (Hackney, Newham, Tower Hamlets, Walthamstow, Greenwich) by Wednesday next week. \r\n\r\nOr am I wishing for the stars as usual? :-)","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/10/01 15:04:03 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/01 15:04:03 +0100","ticket_id":20872704,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/10/02 09:50:10 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/12 17:18:53 +0100","ticket_id":20872704,"value":"3"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/10/01 15:04:03 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/04 17:14:42 +0100","ticket_id":20872704,"value":"6"},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/10/01 15:04:03 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/21 10:56:46 +0100","ticket_id":20872704,"value":"billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/10/01 15:04:03 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/01 15:04:03 +0100","ticket_id":20872704,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/10/02 09:50:10 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/21 10:56:28 +0100","ticket_id":20872704,"value":"3"},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2010/10/21 10:32:52 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/21 10:56:46 +0100","ticket_id":20872704,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2010/10/21 10:56:46 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/21 10:56:46 +0100","ticket_id":20872704,"value":"level_0"}],"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"3","assignee_name":"Janos P Toth","channel":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692462},{"nice_id":1805,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/10/18 11:27:17 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","comments":[{"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"At your convenience!","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:32:01 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Done.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:33:05 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Timewise: took 5mins.\r\nCovered by 1 day attached to this ticket:\r\n  http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/1633","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/18 14:10:56 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Thanks!\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462}],"field_97116":"less than 30mins","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","resolution_time":53,"priority_id":4,"current_tags":"authorized capped","assignee_id":3663591,"problem_id":null,"updated_at":"2011/01/18 16:17:43 +0000","req_name":"Morag Reavley","ticket_type_id":4,"status_updated_at":"2011/01/18 16:17:43 +0000","solved_at":"2010/10/20 16:36:47 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"capped","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/10/18 11:27:17 +0100","via_id":0,"subject":"Please remove Tickets splash page this morning","recipient":null,"organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"score":0,"submitter_id":3692462,"base_score":0,"linkings":[],"latest_recipients":"support+id1805@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":"2010/10/18 12:00:00 +0100","current_collaborators":null,"status_id":4,"description":"At your convenience!","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:27:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:32:01 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":"less than 30mins"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:33:05 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":"capped"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:27:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:27:17 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:27:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:33:05 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":"0"}],"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":null,"assignee_name":"Kieran Topping","channel":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692462},{"nice_id":900,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/05/06 16:56:09 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","comments":[{"created_at":"2010/05/06 16:56:09 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Some weird items appearing in the left nav of this page http://www.london2012.com/fr/nous-contacter.php -

An attempt was made to restart the web server on the host to alleviate this load, however we were initially unable to bring up the web server instance responsible for accepting requests for the URL https://www.london2012.com due to a requirement for an SSL passphrase. The issue was escalated internally at IPsoft, after which the passphrase was determined and fed into the web server to bring the web instance for https://www.london2012.com up on the host.\n\nFor the entire duration of the issue, five other hosts (olympic-web01, olympic-web02, olympic-web04, olympic-web05, olympic-web06) were accepting traffic for the URL https://www.london2012.com . At no time for the duration of the issue was access to https://www.london2012.com impacted. All six hosts have been accepting traffic for that URL since Sunday, October 17th 11:00AM GMT.\n\n======================================\nKindly check and confirm us the closure.\n\n\nThe trouble ticket will be closed if no response is received within 3 days.\n\nIf you require any further assistance, please contact the Service Desk on 0800 731 1713 or via email to ah.support@bt.com\n\nRegards,\nBT Data Centre Services | 0800 731 1713 | ah.support@bt.com | https://www.selfcare.bt.com\n\nThis e-mail contains BT information, which may be privileged or confidential.

An attempt was made to restart the web server on the host to alleviate this load, however we were initially unable to bring up the web server instance responsible for accepting requests for the URL https://www.london2012.com due to a requirement for an SSL passphrase. The issue was escalated internally at IPsoft, after which the passphrase was determined and fed into the web server to bring the web instance for https://www.london2012.com up on the host.\n\nFor the entire duration of the issue, five other hosts (olympic-web01, olympic-web02, olympic-web04, olympic-web05, olympic-web06) were accepting traffic for the URL https://www.london2012.com . At no time for the duration of the issue was access to https://www.london2012.com impacted. All six hosts have been accepting traffic for that URL since Sunday, October 17th 11:00AM GMT.\n\n======================================\nKindly check and confirm us the closure.\n\n\nThe trouble ticket will be closed if no response is received within 3 days.\n\nIf you require any further assistance, please contact the Service Desk on 0800 731 1713 or via email to ah.support@bt.com\n\nRegards,\nBT Data Centre Services | 0800 731 1713 | ah.support@bt.com | https://www.selfcare.bt.com\n\nThis e-mail contains BT information, which may be privileged or confidential.

All the ones that start with Aquatics are just going to be the name of the discipline ie\n\nAquatics - Diving  becomes Diving\nAquatics - Swimming becomes Swimming\nAquatics - Synchronised Swimming becomes Synchronised Swimming\nAquatics - Water Polo becomes Water Polo\n\nVolleyball - Beach needs to become Beach Volleyball\n\nI know it's not quite as simple as just changing the names of the pages because of all associated content (pics being pulled in on sports and venues)... Can you let me know what you can do/ what we can do to make this happen?!\n\nGive me a call and let's talk it through...\n\nThanks very much,\n\nDeborah\n\nDeborah Elstein\nCopywriter\nCommunications and Public Affairs\nDirect line:  +44 (0)20 3 2012 109\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nOne Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\nlondon2012.com\n\n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/10/14 12:09:37 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/14 12:09:37 +0100","ticket_id":21840087,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/10/14 12:23:13 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/15 11:54:42 +0100","ticket_id":21840087,"value":"0.5"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/10/14 12:09:37 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/14 12:09:37 +0100","ticket_id":21840087,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/10/14 12:09:37 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/15 12:23:47 +0100","ticket_id":21840087,"value":"billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/10/14 12:09:37 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/15 12:23:47 +0100","ticket_id":21840087,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/10/14 12:23:13 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/15 11:54:42 +0100","ticket_id":21840087,"value":"0.5"},{"ticket_field_id":357233,"created_at":"2010/10/15 11:55:01 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/15 11:55:01 +0100","ticket_id":21840087,"value":"0"}],"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"0.5","assignee_name":"Kieran Topping","channel":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692169}]
