The deal follows confirmation that ArcelorMittal will fund the construction of a 115m high visitor attraction in the Olympic Park in time for the Games, which will be designed by artist Anish Kapoor and structural engineer Cecil Balmond and named 'The Orbit' during Games time.\n\nAs part of the deal, LOCOG will benefit from the sale of tickets to visit the viewing platform of the tower around the Games, as well as being able to provide hospitality in the tower at Games-time. The tower is expected to be completed by May 2012 and will be an iconic presence on the skyline as well as providing visitors with spectacular views across the Olympic Park.\n\nLOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe commented, \"The Olympic Games and Paralympic Games are already transforming east London and the addition of the Tower at Games-time will provide an added dimension to the Park. We are thrilled to have ArcelorMittal on board as a sponsor and I have great pleasure in welcoming them to the London 2012 family.\"\n\nLakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO of Arcelormittal, said: \"With the Games being the world's biggest sporting event, we felt that London 2012 was the perfect sponsorship opportunity.  We're excited about being associated with this great global sporting event and being able to showcase the versatility of steel at it with the ArcelorMittal Orbit.\" He added, \"I'm also personally pleased to be able to give a little something back with this initiative to London, which has been my home for many years.\"\n\nThe Orbit will stand in the southern part of the Olympic Park between the Stadium and Aquatics Centre.

So thanks!\r\nHowever I still have a couple more questions. They're fairly simple, but I just want to double-check before going ahead and updating all of the metadata (some of the updates are \"destructive\" - i.e. we're effectively discarding information, so I want to get it right!!).\r\n\r\nYou've only explicitly mentioned \"themes\" above. But I just want to double \r\ncheck that this applies to the other metadata types, too. Specifically:\r\n locations (East London,West,All,Greenwich,Hackney,Newham,Tower Hamlets,Walthamstow)\r\n venues    (Greenwich Arena,Paralympic Tennis and archery)\r\nAlso, can you just confirm that theme:Technology is should undergo this action. \r\nI ask, because it doesn't explicitly say \"Remove\" in the spreadsheet (but it IS\r\nin amongst the other \"Removed\" values). \r\n\r\n\"All locations\". The spreadsheet implies that location:All should be moved to\r\nthe \"freetext\" tags. However, I don't think you really mean that hundreds of pages\r\nshould be tagged to \"All\". I'm guessing you want such pages to be tagged to \r\n\"All locations\", rather than simply \"All\". Am I correct?\r\n\r\nSo the three questions are:\r\n1) Should the \"removed\" venues and locations be put into \"freetext\" tags.\r\n2) Is theme:Technology a removed theme?\r\n3) Should \"location:All\" be moved to \"freetext:All\", or \"freetext:All locations\", or maybe even \"location:All locations\".\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKieran\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/05/17 16:12:51 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"internal note: This might go above 2 days, as I've had to go through the spreadsheet line by line, and cross-check with what's in the db.

I can't remember.  If so then freetext:UK-wide and freetext: Host boroughs(I think that's in the doc somewhere), otherwise, location:UK-wide etc. is cool.\r\n-- It's never the Greenwich arena, it's the North Greenwich arena.  And I don't the *think* Paralympic Tennis and Archery are their own venue any more.  So we don't need them to be specific venue, but can't hurt to have them as key words.

We’re definitely going to need you and your wonderful help!\r\n \r\n1.       The splash page we are creating will be as light weight as possible.

In order to cater for the people who come to our site before the splash has had time to propagate, we propose having a SplashB, with only text on it (Something to the effect of ‘Come back to meet our mascots after the One Show’).  This could be pushed live earlier in the day, so all we would need to do is replace the SplashB with the real splash when the time is right.\r\n\r\n7.       The switchover is around 7:30pm.  Because of all the unknowns around traffic, we will definitely need you to be around that evening, and probably on call during the night just in case.  We might need to get into the splash page to switch the video from being on BigButton to Youtube if traffic gets too high.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe main splash html should be ready for Friday.

Huw is looking to get this page onto Akamai\r\n\r\nCool\r\n\r\nbtw. 100% sure how Akamai expect this to work, I assume something like this, maybe Huw could pin someone down at Akamai who is to the point / no nonsense/ hands on sort of person to just check we're all on the same page.\r\n\r\n1) Mascot page does up here, password restricted till launch.\r\n\r\n/mascot/index.html\r\n\r\n2) We replicate this across all servers,  password restricted till launch.\r\n\r\n3)  We may also need to check with Akami if we need to add an extra ESI tags in? [as we have no personalised stuff on that page / assuming no login link, we won't need this]\r\n\r\n4) At launch we remove any password restrictions and add in a redirect form the homepage to /mascot/index.html\r\n\r\nAkamai then cache the first request for this page.\r\n\r\nThis does mean we will still be serving a redirect for every request (much lighter than a page, but still a request/response)\r\n\r\nAlthough I assume Akami will also still make a lightweight request/response to the live servers to check the page hasn't changed / is still cacheable anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n> 6.       In order to cater for the people who come to our site before the splash has had time to propagate, we propose having a SplashB, with only text on it (Something to the effect of ‘Come back to meet our mascots after the One Show’).  This could be pushed live earlier in the day, so all we would need to do is replace the SplashB with the real splash when the time is right.\r\n\r\nIn terms of propagation, how long before Akamai pick up changes? As I understood it if you make a request you ISP checks the Akamai cache [which in turn may be synced with other Akamai caches] and if it's there it uses it else it request a copy and caches it for the next user.\r\n\r\nIf not then yes we could take the approach above, although that may be slightly tricker than a redirect (replacing a page in the CMS can be trickier than it may at first seem, using redirects is far quicker/simpler)\r\n\r\n\r\n> 7.       The switchover is around 7:30pm.\r\n\r\nCan you push to do it before the end of the program, seems will to launch at the exact moment of a spike (ie. people turning off their TV)\r\n\r\nBecause of all the unknowns around traffic, we will definitely need you to be around that evening, and probably on call during the night just in case.  We might need to get into the splash page to switch the video from being on BigButton to Youtube if traffic gets too high.\r\n\r\nOK will make sure I am around..\r\n\r\n> The main splash html should be ready for Friday.  I’m not anticipating it requiring any integration at all, at least for Wednesday.\r\n\r\nOK\r\n\r\nI think the only thing to discuss is how best to use Akamai, although this does depend on the usefulness/hand-on-ness of the person Huw can get for us to speak to...\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/05/12 14:53:55 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":19,"value":"Ticket #447 \"Mascot microsite (splash page)\" was closed and merged into this ticket.\r\n\r\nLast Comment in #447: Due date approaching.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/05/12 19:21:18 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi again,\r\n\r\nHere's my plans for timing.

This is a technical task, but should be fairly easy for anyone with basic technical knowledge to do, please let me know if you woudl like some more detailed instructions on this; it may make sense to add them to any 'emergency plan' you have.\r\n\r\nii) An emergency site, in case of well, emergencies. I guess the two things you are covering here are \r\n\r\na) the facility to have ready / put up a simple site in case of a major issue or news story and you just want all attention focused on that and not the site as a whole \r\n\r\nb) an issue with networks etc. and you just want a site you can edit by hand [it should be noted you can already edit 99% of the site by hand as it is all HTML/PHP on the live severs].\r\n\r\nIf you create a small site within /temporary/pages/html/ (or any other directory) we can write up some notes for you on how we would \r\n\r\na) switch to it and\r\nb) how you could edit it on the live servers directly if need be.\r\n\r\nThe third thing you may want is a copy of that emergency site synced to a server *outside* of the main server environment, this is something I haven't covered in this ticket but may be worth considering.  \r\n\r\nSo the things not covered in this ticket (which you may want to open a separate ticket for, but may want to discuss first) are:\r\n\r\n- documentation on switching to maintenance mode for 3rd parties (above what is described above, this will have a technical element) \r\n- documentation on switching to an emergency site for 3rd parties (above what is described above, this will have a technical element) \r\n- editing of the emergency site direct on the live server and how to sync content to the rest of the farm (familiarity with HTML and FTP will be required as will access the the servers, you may need to decide who and how people get access to the live servers to make sure we don't breach any security implications)\r\n- synchronization of emergency site to a 3rd party server (it may be that you want this server outside of BT's network to cover all eventualities)\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nSwitching to a temp page for maintenance, this is commented otu in .htaccess at the root of the site\r\n\r\n# -- TEMPORARY / MAINTINANCE
