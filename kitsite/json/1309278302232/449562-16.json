The issue lies in the fact that we have 6 live servers with no central/single database (ie. a simple public facing mysql database) in which to track clicks.\n\nIdeally we'd just have one server (even if that was just web06) that was addressed as banners.london2012.com that served up / tracked all banners, that way we could have a single DB of all users and then each time a banner was clicked we updated a row in the database.\n\nIn normal circumstances I would simply suggest that we ask BT to setup a new server/instance (banners.london2012.com) and we'd be home and dry; but realise the issues around this / the unlikeliness of this happening. Another approach would be to rent some cloud hosting off a 3rd party (ie. MediaTemple) to just handle the banner serving/tracking, this would solve the issue and be low cost ~$50/month would probably get you all the bandwidth/capacity you needed). But I can understand why ITS may be uneasy about that. Although we do actually already do this (ie. use some cloud hosting from MediaTemple) to handle images arriving from Getty via FTP, this was discussed with Morag/ODA although ITS may not be aware of it; it is also more a backend process/server between Getty and the CMS.\n</snipdepends on reporting requirements>\n\nIf we don't have a central DB we could still store signups but we won't be able to track clicks on each banner with the same level of granularity and/or create a dedicated reporting interface.\n\nWe could track most of the data in Google Analytics by serving the banner in an IFRAME the only thing to be aware of if we took that approach is that the data may not be as readily available on a single page.\n\nSo...to recap ;-)\n\nIf you happy with us tracking the data in Google Analytics (ie. no single reporting page) then the times at the top still stand.\n\nIf you want a single ie. a single reporting page / db then the times/costs aren't widely different, but we would need a server with a mysql DB (or be able to provision on ourselves from say MediaTemple)\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/12/03 16:55:35 +0000","attachments":[{"size":48532,"created_at":"2010/12/03 16:55:35 +0000","content_type":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/yabvgho62jhqugh/?name=link-to-us-data-201011.xlsx","token":"yabvgho62jhqugh","id":13087680,"filename":"link-to-us-data-201011.xlsx","is_public":true}],"via_id":4,"value":"Hey Jamie,\n\nSo, I think what we would like is to keep it Google analytics based, but to create a ‘campaign’ called ‘link to us’ ... so that the link embedded on the images contains a GA tag (i don’t think we need an iFrame for this?) that we can then track it’s click-usage. I believe that would work? I’ve attached the report we are getting at the moment (we don’t currently have any tracking after download at all), so as long as we can continue to collect all the attached data and have a basic understanding of how much traffic is coming through to us from the banners in general, we should be ok.\n\nI think having it be more interactive (choose theme, then size) would be a nice idea.

In particular the most common phones used by Samsung staff, whatever that is? We therefore thought it wise not to auto-redirect sites using the Android browser until that testing had been done, in case it upset your Mobile sponsor, once you're happy we can auto-redirect to it.\n\nJust to clarify:\n\nThe iPhone is a combined device+OS+software ie. it only has one browser (Safari) and most importantly one screen size (iphone size) so we know it displays correctly on *every* iPhone out there.\n\nAndroid is an Operating System (like Windows or Linux) it's *not* a device and it therefore doesn't specify a screen size, in fact Android doesn't even guarantee you'll be using a given web browser, although most likely you'll be using the default one, which (as luck would have it) is exactly the same rendering engine as Safari on an iPhone. What this means is that any phone running Android with a screen size similar to the iPhone will render the site exactly as it is rendered on an iPhone.\n\nThe issue is not Android vs iPhone OS (ie. the Operating System of the phone) it's that if someone is running Android on a device with the screen size of a postage stamp the site might not display /exactly/ as intended. Maybe it would be more correct to say \"The mobile site will work on any device running Android with a screen size similar to the iPhone\" (which I expect is 95%+ of the Android market).\n\nIn short the site will render perfectly on any Android device with decent sized rectangular screen.\n\nDo let me know if you need *any* clarification here, as I think we probably need to quickly reel in any confusion that may have been caused.\n\nJamie\n\n(*) 'Android friendly' really only makes sense in terms of Apps and /not/ websites, because an application (as opposed to a website) is dependent on the OS the phone is running. So while you can say \"My app (only) runs on Android and/or iPhone\" the same doesn't really apply to a website. My guess is there may have been a small amount of confusion here.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/11/16 12:11:43 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Aha!

Now this shouldn't be an issue and if you have a phone with a screen the size of a postage stamp I expect your used to seeing sites not rending as expected.\n\nBut and this is the important thing, we can't guarantee that the site will look perfect on all phones running the Android OS, it's a bit like we can guarantee that the main www site will look OK on a PC with a 14 monitor.\n\nAll that said the site is basic HTML with a some simple Javascript, which should degrade gracefully on almost any mobile browser, so can't imagine it looking too wrong even on a really badly designed phone.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/11/19 14:05:40 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Should we also auto direct Andoid handsets then?\r\n\r\n* IMO I think it's probably safe ","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/11/22 08:59:58 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Yes, go for it!\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2010/11/22 10:58:54 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Marking as high.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/11/23 10:44:17 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Janos,\r\n\r\nCan we add in a redirect for the Android UA \r\n\r\n* remember to up ticket time to account for testing on dev (and staging? <-- may nto be possible yet)","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/11/23 10:46:31 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"anos,\r\n\r\nCan we add in a redirect for the Android UA\r\n\r\nAlso need to be a bit more intelligent on the redirects so we can go back to main www site (and visa versa)\r\n\r\n* remember to up ticket time to account for testing on dev (and staging? <-- may not be possible yet)","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/11/23 10:58:21 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Staging: I don't expect we will be using it before jan.","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/12/14 15:01:25 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Checking if it works all right on an android (emulator) then amending the redirects.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":4323506},{"created_at":"2011/01/05 10:54:59 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"i think we should send this live.

The upshot is that - even if scheduling was working perfectly - your page would not have appeared on the live site for up to 5 or 6 minutes (sometimes even longer, at busy times).\r\nThe next time you schedule a page for publication could you let us know before you do it please, so that someone can (virtually!) look over your shoulder to see what is going wrong.\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nKieran\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/08/17 10:59:36 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hi Kieran \n\n \n\nI must admit, I didn't wait for 5 mins as our press team where sending\nout a press notice and need a link. \n\n \n\nI'll make sure I let you guys know in advance, next time. \n\n \n\nThanks for checking. \n\nUzma. \n\n \n\nUzma Khan\n\nCommunications Assistant \n\nCommunications \n\nDirect line: 020 3023 6927\n\n \n\nOlympic Delivery Authority\n\nMailpoint: 7a\n\n23rd Floor, One Churchill Place\n\nLondon E14 5LN\n\n \n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\n\nwww.london2012.com  \n\n \n\nFind out what is going on at London 2012 HQ - http://blog.london2012.com\n \n\n \n\n*\n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":8189631},{"created_at":"2010/08/23 11:38:16 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":19,"value":"Ticket #1169 \"RE: Scheduling in the CMS\" was closed and merged into this ticket.\r\n\r\nLast Comment in #1169: Uzma,\r\n\r\nCan you please be sure to send this to the support@postcms.zendesk.com email address.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nLiz\r\n\r\nFrom: Uzma Khan [mailto:Uzma.Khan@london2012.com]\r\nSent: 12 August 2010 12:04\r\nTo: support@postcms.com\r\nCc: Alexandra Brown; Liz Goulding\r\nSubject: Scheduling in the CMS\r\n\r\nHi guys\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a problem with the scheduling of jobs in the CMS.\r\n\r\nA few days ago we set the scheduler in the CMS to expire some jobs on the 11 Of August at 5.00, however this wasn't done.

If you select \"Other date...\" from the popdown, you are allowed to manually enter a date. This needs amending as follows:\r\n\r\n 1.1. We (maybe) need a message to appear, indicating that you should enter the date in \"yyyy/mm/dd\" or \"yyyy/mm/dd hh24:mi\" format. \r\n 1.2. We need to double-check (in javascript), when you click on \"Done\" that the date format meets the above date spec, and display an error msg if it doesn't. It would probably make sense to check for dates in the past, too.\r\n 1.3. If you decide that you /don't/ want to manually specify a date, you need to be able to get back to the original popdown (ask me if you don't know what I mean here).\r\n 1.4. If the date spec includes a time, this needs to be parsed, and sent in the xcall.\r\n\r\nI've estimated up to a day for this, but it might take less.\r\n\r\nAny questions, give me a shout.\r\n\r\nPS \"Clear\" in the Schedule popup means \"Completely clear this item's schedule\" - i.e. it performs the xcall - it doesn't just clear the values in the window.\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/18 16:07:01 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Schedule now is a bit smarter - more comfortable to set an arbitrary date + there are some checks to make sure user sets a valid publication / expiry date.
