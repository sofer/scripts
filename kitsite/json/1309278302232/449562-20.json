Once we deploy the code we're going to test it works and I can't see any possibility of it bringing the server down after we have confirmed it works, if in the worse case scenario a bug did get in then we'd obviously roll back the change immediately. Therefore the impact on BT is zero and the impact on the rest of the business is similar to an editorial change that has been checked.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it the rational for CAB is so that:\r\n\r\ni) Should a problem arise with the servers BT/IPSOFT/ITS (or the help desk) can look back and see what has changed and therefore decide whether an incident may be affected by a recent change. This really makes most sense in terms of server configuration changes (something we have been increasingly reluctant to do for a while now, for exactly these reason) and not content, markup or template changes.\r\n\r\nii) CAB can decide that it's not a good idea for a change to be made in case it clashes with (for example) a political sensitive date/event or another significant change due to happen round that time (ie. a change to the network).\r\n\r\nIn terms of timescale I'm passing that bit over to Kieran to answer.\r\n\r\nAlthough I would expect we'd be able to get it done this month.\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/11/09 12:54:00 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Thanks for this response. I agree with your view on CRs - and think this is supported by the info I sent round yesterday re: what merits a CR vs just a Servicedesk ticket. \r\n\r\nJust for clarity on our requirements - we want to be able to give Volunteers a flag in the Supporters box, but we also want to be able to keep the Volunteers field and data live within the UMS (though not on the sign-up form), so that we can see going forwards which of our supporters had also expressed an interest in being a Volunteer. We are aiming to send an email to Supporters who had expressed interest in volunteering, which means we need to be able to see who is in both lists. \r\n\r\nRe: timescale we would actually want to bring this forward earlier if possible - could it be done this week at all?

As for some reason it doesn't seem to be recorded here ... this is what they've advised us:\n(for example): /TechnologyInternships should be 'autogenerated' when /technologyinternships is raised, but it should point directly to the full address and not via /technologyinternships\n\nDoes that make sense? And I definitely understand that it could be a lot of (not necessary) work -- it could be easier to just manually add in a few specific ones...\n\nI'm happy to set up a call with the SEO guys, though, if you would find it helpful!\n________________________________________\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3709935},{"created_at":"2010/10/19 15:33:46 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Ok, well ... it looks to me as if they're saying that:\r\n TechnologyInternships\r\nshould redirect directly to:\r\n get-involved/jobs/working-for-locog/locog-technology-internship-programme/index.php\r\n\r\ni.e. without any kind of \"intermediate\" redirect. i.e. they DON'T want multiple redirects to occur. i.e. they DON'T want:\r\n TechnologyInternships\r\nto redirect to:\r\n technologyinternships\r\nwhich - in turn - redirects to\r\n get-involved/jobs/working-for-locog/locog-technology-internship-programme/index.php\r\n\r\nIf I've understood their requirement correctly then ... we meet it, to the letter.

Here's what I've done:\r\n- if the user doesn't have javascript, navigation is on the bottom and\r\nhitting the contents button rolls to the bottom of the page (ie to the\r\nnavigation)\r\n- if the user has javascript, the navigation is on the bottom on the\r\npage initially\r\n- if the user hits the contents button, it turns into a pull-down menu\r\n(and disappears from the bottom)\r\n\r\nSo it progressively enhances as the device gets smarter.

Do you mean you\r\n> can't access the archive on a Blackberry?\r\nWe can now with the bottom navigation.\r\n\r\n> - About us content - I will prepare and send through asap\r\nGreat, do let me know if there's any update on that.\r\n\r\n> - Links to other pages outside the mobile site - this is my biggest\r\n> concern.

The general assessment that this is almost ready to go live. There are three relatively minor (.5-1 day) tasks:\r\n\r\n1. Links to the normal site + external links\r\nSome news articles and blogs link to the normal website and external sites. We discussed pop-up alerts, but I reckon we've since found a very reasonable solution for external links: the little icon next to the link we're currently using on the normal site. I suggest to make it a bit more sophisticated:\r\n - internal links (that point to another mobile page) just act like as normal links\r\n - external links work like on the standard homepage: they get an external link icon and open in new tab/window\r\n - internal london2012.com links that point to a desktop page get a different icon and open in a new tab\r\nThis would make 'risky' links more obvious and we could help the user stay on the mobile website.\r\n\r\n2. Prev / Next links on news and mobile pages\r\nThis is a bit confusing: on the mobile page, we have 'prev' and 'next' buttons under every news and blog article. This is something we don't have on the desktop site. The problem is they are prone to break due to publication issues. Two options here:\r\n- Get rid of 'next' / 'prev' buttons altogether (we don't take away a lot from functionality, but will be less confusing)\r\n- Make 'next' / 'prev' pages work (with php file check) - this sounds a bit time consuming and has a small risk of running away\r\n\r\n3. london2012.com => london2012.com/mobile redirect when visited with mobile devices.\r\nThis has two parts:\r\n- m.london2012.com should redirect to london2012.com/mobile\r\n- if someone enters www.london2012.com with a mobile device, redirect to london2012.com/mobile\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":4323506},{"created_at":"2010/10/05 14:32:51 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Sorry for delay in responding to this.
