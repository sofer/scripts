Will Visit Britain pull it every time a page loads on their site or will they retrieve it once a day and cache it.

Also I assume we'd only deliver upcoming events?\n\nIf Visit Britain are happy to accept the XML fields/format we use internally, then it's probably a couple of days work to create the web service to return the relevant events as XML and expose them via an API key.\n\nPast experience has shown that even the simplest feeds tends to have a bit of bedding in the first time it is used, hence why I think we'd need a couple of days to get it working.\n\nIt would be best to be clear what we are delivering in advance and get that signed off as constant back / forth and changes with regards to fields etc. will quickly drive the cost up. The simplest format is for us to deliver the XML feed in our own format using our own field names. Although it may be that Visit Britain would prefer it as an extended RSS feed with each field as optional meta data values.\n\nThe question to them is probably \"Are you OK pulling back a XML feed back of all upcoming events in 2012 internal format once a day via a web service and caching the results?\"\n\nre. picking it up once a day would be no issue at all, once an hour would be no issue, it's more if every request to Visit Britain's homepage caused a hit on 2012 that we may have issues. In fact a XML web service call would come direct from the CMS (which we host) and not from the live environment at all. The easiest thing would be for Visit Britain to just 'cache' a local copy each day and then render their local copy of the file/data.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/06/09 15:34:41 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hi Jagdeep,\n\nFinn is talking to Visit Britain about supplying them with a 'feed' of events.\n\nMy concern was them retrieving a (RSS style) feed 'real time' and then displaying it prominently on their site ie. the home page.

Also I assume we'd only deliver upcoming events?\n\nIf Visit Britain are happy to accept the XML fields/format we use internally, then it's probably a couple of days work to create the web service to return the relevant events as XML and expose them via an API key.\n\nPast experience has shown that even the simplest feeds tends to have a bit of bedding in the first time it is used, hence why I think we'd need a couple of days to get it working.\n\nIt would be best to be clear what we are delivering in advance and get that signed off as constant back / forth and changes with regards to fields etc. will quickly drive the cost up. The simplest format is for us to deliver the XML feed in our own format using our own field names. Although it may be that Visit Britain would prefer it as an extended RSS feed with each field as optional meta data values.\n\nThe question to them is probably \"Are you OK pulling back a XML feed back of all upcoming events in 2012 internal format once a day via a web service and caching the results?\"\n\nre. picking it up once a day would be no issue at all, once an hour would be no issue, it's more if every request to Visit Britain's homepage caused a hit on 2012 that we may have issues. In fact a XML web service call would come direct from the CMS (which we host) and not from the live environment at all. The easiest thing would be for Visit Britain to just 'cache' a local copy each day and then render their local copy of the file/data.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/06/15 11:45:09 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"I think somewhere in between?

But Visit Britain may need a 'clean' XML feed without blocks of markup wrapped in CDATA.

I have no strong preference to them being used this way, this just what I sort of expected based on previous emails)\r\n\r\nI realise that one of the main criteria you are hoping to use it for is testing of the load balancers and Apache configs (which will be immensely useful) and therefore you possibly weren't seeing them as part of the live (everyday) publication workflow, maybe you were? once again happy to use them either way.\r\n\r\nObviously if we have a static / self contained website it is very easy to just place it on the staging servers, see if it works and then copy it across to the live servers if it does.\r\n\r\nHowever when we have a new section of the main site (like /get-involved/volunteering) that is intrinsically tied to other pages on the main site / shares components with the live CMS and utilises feeds running on the live CMS it is not quite so simple to separate out the site to a separate server.\r\n\r\nThe approach I have outlined in the diagram below (and in my email last week) re-routes the current publication from \"CMS to web01\" to \"CMS to staging server01\" this gives us an opportunity to limit the RSYNC (completely, by file type or by section) between the staging environment and web01 and therefore view the site on the staging servers first.\r\n\r\nThe downside of this approach is that staging 01 and 02 become part of the publication workflow and therefore if they are unavailable publication will break.\r\n\r\nA complete shutdown of the rsync will also hold up everyday editorial publication, therefore I suggest we look at an intelligent way of limiting what is automatically rynced and what has to be pushed by hand.\r\n\r\nI think we probably also need to decide which of these the new servers is really (or most importantly) for:\r\n\r\n- testing out config changes to Apache and/or the load balancer and Akamai\r\n- testing out standalone new sites\r\n- a real time mirror of the live environment that all changes have first to pass though (question around delays to editorial publication and how we deal with these)\r\n- limiting the automatic syncing to the live environment of certain kinds of global files (css / js etc.)\r\n- limiting the automatic syncing to the live environment of certain sections\r\n- limiting the automatic syncing to the live environment  completely in the case of a relaunch (question around delays to editorial publication and how we deal with these)\r\n\r\nThe one big question that needs clarifying I think is whether we expect these servers to be part of the live everyday production workflow (if they are, we can't just turn them off / reboot them at will) or do they simply hold a 'clone' of the existing published site (ie. whatever is on web01 although that does imply they are only useful for testing config changes and not 'staging').\r\n\r\nI have included on the diagram our existing / internal dev/staging environment for completeness, what is important to note here is that the editorial content on this server is not the same as the live content, it is a periodic clone of the content held in the CMS, which makes it useful for development/testing but not for handling a real time staging->production workflow. \r\n\r\nJamie\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603}],"field_97116":"0.4","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/06/01 10:24:17 +0100","resolution_time":194,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"bill_to_its","assignee_id":3686603,"problem_id":null,"updated_at":"2010/09/07 13:16:31 +0100","req_name":"Jagdeep Bhambra","ticket_type_id":1,"status_updated_at":"2010/09/07 13:16:31 +0100","solved_at":"2010/06/09 12:30:08 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"bill_to_its","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/06/01 10:24:17 +0100","via_id":0,"subject":"ITS: Feedback on server environment for volunteering site","recipient":null,"organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"score":0,"submitter_id":3640926,"base_score":0,"linkings":[],"latest_recipients":null,"due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"status_id":4,"description":"[see recent email correspondence -
