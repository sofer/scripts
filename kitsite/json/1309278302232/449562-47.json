If your sure your entering them into the \"Free Text field\" in Getty then let me know the next time one is sent over and we can try and look at the feed file before it's loaded into the CMS.

I haven't sent these to CommCorp yet, though best to get your feedback and decide is any are just non-starters or additions needed, before asking them to comment further.\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\nI think my preference would be Route 1 keeping the data / mailing list preferences in the main site / UMS and  creating a nicer way for you to export any given list to Communicator Corp from within the UMS interfaces (as this give you the most control/ flexibility going forward).\r\n\r\nAlthough you may prefer Route 3 whereby we send a mini profile across to Communicator Corp each time a user either i) registers and confirms their email or ii) updates their details. The two things to be aware of if we go down this route are i) that if you later on add a new field to the user profile you won't be able to export users based on that field to Communicator core without changes to both Communcator Corps data model and the API between the UMS and CommCorp and ii) there may also be a cost involved in getting CommCorp to set up a more advanced profile (so that they can hold mailing list preferences and additional user data such as Location). In the route the actual mailing list preferences are still managed form the main site.\r\n\r\nThe second Route 2 works on the basis that we drop all mailing lists from the main site and just send users to CommCorp to manage their mailing list preferences, this is very much a bare bones / basic integration. It assumes the main site now knows nothing about mailing lists or email (other than that a user has confirmed their address). If we need to keep Name, Location etc. in sync we will need to build additional API's (very much like those described in route 3)\r\n\r\nRoute 1\r\n----------\r\n- Profile and register page for all data (including mailing lists) stays at www.london2012.com / UMS\r\n- Slicing / dicing of users to mail happens in the UMS/CMS (we will improve the interface to allow this to be a near seamless process, if this route is chosen)\r\n- Unsubscribes are handled back at the main site (and in future export these users wont' be sent across if they have unsubed from a given list)\r\n- Main site will know about about email preferences and/or bounces\r\n- Replies to emails are the same in all routes, LOCOG need to decide if an automated email with help / common questions / how to unsub will suffice or if a more personal response need to be sent and if so if that is a manageable task.\r\n\r\nRoute 2\r\n----------\r\n- We move all mailing list signup to a 3rd party page on CommCorp\r\n- Integration between the two may give a bad experience\r\n- Changes to the UMS wont' be reflected in CommCorp\r\n- Main site won't know anythign about email or bounces\r\n\r\nRoute 3\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- Similar to Route 1 in many way, but instead of exporting a list of users to CommCorp before a mailout is sent we will continually export data to CommCorp (in effect CommCorp becomes a slave databse)\r\n- May incur additional costs at CommCorp to hold a more complex data model\r\n- Changes to the main UMS data model won't be reflected automatically in CommCorp will require new dev work each time this happens.\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/01/25 15:57:17 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Jamie, presumably the documentation is not an 8-point job.
