But this could mean the existing home page template gets cluttered up and bugs introduced, so..\r\n\r\nI think my preferred approach (I think the same as what you are suggesting) would be to keep the main home page as the master and then have an alternative versions (that are *never* manually linked to in the CMS or else we could hit issues when we delete the alternatives) each with a different Google tag to mark the variation and then set-up a redirect on the front end of the site to randomly alternate users between the different versions over a period of time.
