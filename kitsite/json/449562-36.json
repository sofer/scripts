We already minimise libraries where the biggest savings can be made.\r\n\r\n3) *BUT* we do have a solution that solves the above, it will involve some small development work but will minimise disruption to workflow and offer lots of advantages (basically we are going to suggest that we merge and compress the CSS and JS into two respective files at delivery time with a caching mechanism)\r\n\r\nAgain *Don't feed this back to ITS* I feel like there is probably enough antagonism already and I certainly don't want to stoke the fire!! \r\n\r\nBut our feeling is that we can do *lots of things* to improve the speed of the site (especially if starting from scratch) and are happy to do so (I imagine we can suggest lots of things ITS haven't even thought of themselves). There are also things you can ask for when commissioning new designs and internally when creating new images, which will make the biggest savings of all.\r\n\r\nBut I think is slightly unfair of ITS with no understanding of the site, workflow, our role/remit, legacy of how we we're supplied code (and the time scales we worked to once delivered that code, ie. no time to say \"errm, this could be slightly more efficient\") to ask us to make changes without understanding their impact.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's not my place to say this, but I feel this could have been so better handled by initially asking to talk to us to understand why certain things are as they are and how they can be improved both now and in future. Rather than getting hung up on minimising CSS and JS files, as if we are unaware of the possibility of doing this (which TBH we fund rather patronising).\r\n\r\nWe do really clever stuff in the CMS (and other sites) with regards to reducing the footprint of CSS and JS files, but in these cases we are talking about minimising ~700k Javascript and CSS files down to a quarter of that size, which is a *real* saving (when we're trying to keep the 'total page' weight to under ~250k). We also have a different workflow in terms of how those JS and CSS files get generated. We also deliver all the icons as sprites, but once again those are never updated editorially. We also have clever cache headers and intelligent ETags in the CMS. But we have never been asked to implement these cache based performance optimisations on the 2012 site. Although in fact *we do keep an overview on things like this out of good will*. In fact only last week I fixed the Apache ETags on the live BT servers (and didn't charge you for it) which fixed an issue with the ETag's being output incorrectly making the pages largely un-cacheable (driving up your bandwidth bill and users download times).\r\n\r\nIf you'd like us to suggest more things like this in future then we're happy to so pre-emptily, maybe it is our fault in that we should have hassled you more in terms of \"We think the way this JS/CSS as supplied is less than optimal\" or \"We could improve your cache headers\" (but in truth the site didn't seem to have performance or bandwidth issues so we figured this was of a lower priority for now).\r\n\r\nMy point is we can sit down and have a really mature conversation around where we can make optimisations and whether they are better made now or as part of a new future redesign. Additionally knowing the site and CMS as we do we also can make some real world suggestions that may not have been thought about.\r\n\r\nFor a start no one at ITS has even mentioned Expired headers and an intelligent caching strategy (we have never built one as we assumed as the web host this was BT job, but more than happy to plan one out for you). This would *substantially reduce bandwidth* as all images and assets would  be cached down stream by a CDN or local ISP.\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/02/16 14:17:39 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Jamie,\n\n \n\nAll your work/thoughts around this are appreciated, and I agree with the\nsuggested approach/handling of this in future!
