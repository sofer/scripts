This would involve more work than agreed as we'd need to align the widget to every type of content we have.\r\n\r\nNo screen shot as we don't think this is a practical route atm  but hopefully you can imagine what we are talking about.\r\n\r\n- Option 2 (footer)\r\n\r\nPutting the share widget on the bottom of the page as per the original design (although this was only supplied in a closed / single icon state)\r\n\r\nThis can be put to everywhere (as every page has a footer). However it's on a blindspot location, one needs to scroll to the very bottom of the page to find it. \r\n\r\nThe attached screen has two states i) is if the 'share this page' text is clicked on the second ii) is if the 'email a friend' link is selected (the default closed stare isn't shown, but is just the icon and text on the bar)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Option 3 (a new tab in global navigation)\r\n\r\nThis involves an additional menu item in the top menu. Works the same as the other drop down menu items, so no additional learning curve for the user to use the feature. Slightly changed tab color indicates it's\r\na bit different functionality than the actual menu, and draws the attention to it. The drop down menu give us more scope to fit in functionality to tie in with to socials networks (ie. an invite your friends functionality later on). \r\n\r\nThe attached screen has two states i) one is the standard closed state the second ii) is the 'email a friend' box\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth options 1 and 2 have a similar implementation costs so it's really down to which one you think has the most benefit / least impact on key elements of the design.\r\n\r\nI'm personally leaning towards 3, but need to make sure you are happy with spacing once the shop tab is reinstated as it woudl fill the top bar.\r\n\r\nIf you happy progressing on either can you just add a comment to that effect on the ticket itself if you'd like to discuss further feel free to call me.\r\nhttp://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/254\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/03/03 17:32:18 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Option 2, take 1 here: http://london2012dev.kitsite.com/ - Liz, I'm not sure you have access to this one.
