Essentially that's the HTML builds for the three forms (generic, business, festival). I'm assuming these will come from Kitsite, is that right? They should be able to repurpose the forms they already have in place\"\r\n\r\nIf I understand this requirement correctly we need to create 2 pages similar to this page [ https://www.london2012.com/settings/register.php ] for normal and business signups and one similar to the Festival signup form [http://festival.london2012.com/]. On page load the user should be presented with a box to enter their email address, on submission of this form/email the page should reload with a 'hole' in the middle of it for the iFrame (the contents of which will depend on the form specified and the users email address).Yes, that’s correct.\r\n\r\n1) In terms of the standard form(s) (see attached):\r\n\r\nClarification of requirements:\r\n\r\n- Two new pages /settings/esignup.php (normal) and /settings/esignupb.php (business) [URL's TBC] both based on the same template using the layout of the exiting register page (header, footer, side nav)\r\n- Design of form for user to enter their email address (based on login form, see attached) As per your mock up, essentially the existing login/signup page with the “Are you already registered with London 2012?” section removed \r\n\r\nOK\r\n\r\n- Implementation of functionality to check an email address was correctly entered and display an error message if not. That’s correct, you’ll need to do this. We can supply our java script code for this if that helps?\r\n\r\nWe already have some server side (and front end) validation code we can use, but thanks for the offer..\r\n \r\nAlthough your mentioning of JS validation made me think of accessibility, I know that LOOCG have quite stringent accessibility requirements (which often get picked up at the 11th hour by the ability testing company when it comes to signoff).\r\n \r\nKate/Morag: It may be worth checking early on with Ability.net that the use of an iFrame won't cause you to fall short on your accessibility requirements, I know this has happened on a couple of projects recently and meant that work has to be re-though-out / reimplemented just as that work was otherwise about to launch.\r\n \r\n- Implementation of functionality to convert email entered and page/form used (business or standard) into a eDialog url used to load the iFrame.\r\n- We are expecting only to design the form / functionality for the user to enter their email address and convert this into an eDialog url which we then pull into an iFrame. We are not expecting to be providing creative or markup for the signups form(s) themselves. That’s fine. Can you please supply the HTML for the current forms so we can amend for our iFrame, including any CSS files? Is there any chance you could get this over to us by EOD Thurs?\r\n\r\nhttps://www.london2012.com/settings/register.php\r\nhttps://www.london2012.com/settings/register.php?reason=businessProfile\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n- What is the maximum height of the iFrame (as we'll need to set this) for the standard and business forms? For normal and business we’ll need to confirm once we’ve re-jigged the forms, but we’ll keep to the existing width – can you please confirm what that is? For festival, we’ll work within the existing dimensions of the box – can you please confirm what these are?\r\n\r\n460 px wide for the forms / pages on the main site (see screen grab attached)\r\n\r\n- What are the urls for the respective forms / iFrames (ie. how do we convert a users email address / form type into a url for the iFrame) Will need to confirm once our project engineering team has begun the build\r\n\r\nOK\r\n\r\n2) In terms of the Festival signup form\r\n\r\nThis is more complex that the above forms as the current signup process / form is not a single step form, click signup square on this form [ http://festival.london2012.com/ ] \r\n\r\nI think there first needs to be a discussion with the Culture team about how these details are reformatted to fit into a single frame,. The Culture team should also be aware that the new form may function differently to the current form (in particular the user journey for users who already have a profile, as I understand it they will be asked to check their email where they will receive a link to the generic eDialog profile manager, rather than being able to signup in situ. Also how any input validation is handled as I expect this may also have to change. I will pick this up with Kate, but yes you’re right, the customer journey will probably have to change here from what it is currently. \r\n\r\nOnce that is decided then the Festival site will need to be re-coded to present the user with a email form (this will need a small amount of creative signed off) which doesn't cause the page to reload when submitted (unlike the above forms) after that the process of loading the iFrame should be very similar to the mechanism used above for the standard and business forms.\r\n\r\nIm not sure of exact timescales, but the Festival site is due to re-lauch this summer in a Phase II format. It may therefore make more sense to focus on at implementing the eDialog style forms into that version of the festival site (where you can have early input in the design / signup process) rather than trying to shoe-horn an eDialog/iFrame style sign form in place of the current multi step form. Does the area where the iframe will sit have different dimensions when phase II is launched? If so, then makes sense for us to develop with phase II in mind.\r\n\r\nI would expect it to be different, it is a much larger site, but AFAIK design work hasn't even started - we are not involved with the design, probably best if Kate (or Morag) speak with the Culture team and/or Wahome Muchiri [the project manger for the Festival site within the New Media team at LOCOG] who I have cc'd in) \r\n\r\n== Timescales \r\n\r\nIn terms of timescales (for part 1, the standard forms) we could centrally create a 'test' page (on the live or staging server) with a iFrame and a fixed url for the 10th (so that eDialog) could test the iFrame in situ *although* we would need another week (15th July) to implement the email signup box and to dynamically create the urls used to pull a page from eDialog into the iFrame. That’s fine.\r\n\r\nIn terms of switch over, do you have a time you are expecting to swap over as we'll need to work out a migartion strategy to re-map the old signup / register urls to the new page.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n \r\nJamie\r\n \r\nBefore committing to creating or updating the festival site (part 2). I think (if you haven't already done so) it may make sense to see how your timelines and the festival timelines overlap with regards to the Phase II site and then decide if it makes more sense to implement the eDialog signup functionality into that Phase II site (at the design stage) rather than trying to re-factor the current site (as I expect there will be small but non inconsequential implementation / refactoring issues here).\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited \r\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819\r\nThis E-mail is confidential.

On page load the user should be presented with a box to enter their email address, on submission of this form/email the page should reload with a 'hole' in the middle of it for the iFrame (the contents of which will depend on the form specified and the users email address).Yes, that’s correct.\r\n\r\n1) In terms of the standard form(s) (see attached):\r\n\r\nClarification of requirements:\r\n\r\n- Two new pages /settings/esignup.php (normal) and /settings/esignupb.php (business) [URL's TBC] both based on the same template using the layout of the exiting register page (header, footer, side nav)\r\n- Design of form for user to enter their email address (based on login form, see attached) As per your mock up, essentially the existing login/signup page with the “Are you already registered with London 2012?” section removed \r\n\r\nOK\r\n\r\n- Implementation of functionality to check an email address was correctly entered and display an error message if not. That’s correct, you’ll need to do this. We can supply our java script code for this if that helps?\r\n\r\nWe already have some server side (and front end) validation code we can use, but thanks for the offer..\r\n \r\nAlthough your mentioning of JS validation made me think of accessibility, I know that LOOCG have quite stringent accessibility requirements (which often get picked up at the 11th hour by the ability testing company when it comes to signoff).\r\n \r\nKate/Morag: It may be worth checking early on with Ability.net that the use of an iFrame won't cause you to fall short on your accessibility requirements, I know this has happened on a couple of projects recently and meant that work has to be re-though-out / reimplemented just as that work was otherwise about to launch.\r\n \r\n- Implementation of functionality to convert email entered and page/form used (business or standard) into a eDialog url used to load the iFrame.\r\n- We are expecting only to design the form / functionality for the user to enter their email address and convert this into an eDialog url which we then pull into an iFrame. We are not expecting to be providing creative or markup for the signups form(s) themselves. That’s fine. Can you please supply the HTML for the current forms so we can amend for our iFrame, including any CSS files? Is there any chance you could get this over to us by EOD Thurs?\r\n\r\nhttps://www.london2012.com/settings/register.php\r\nhttps://www.london2012.com/settings/register.php?reason=businessProfile\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n- What is the maximum height of the iFrame (as we'll need to set this) for the standard and business forms? For normal and business we’ll need to confirm once we’ve re-jigged the forms, but we’ll keep to the existing width – can you please confirm what that is? For festival, we’ll work within the existing dimensions of the box – can you please confirm what these are?\r\n\r\n460 px wide for the forms / pages on the main site (see screen grab attached)\r\n\r\n- What are the urls for the respective forms / iFrames (ie. how do we convert a users email address / form type into a url for the iFrame) Will need to confirm once our project engineering team has begun the build\r\n\r\nOK\r\n\r\n2) In terms of the Festival signup form\r\n\r\nThis is more complex that the above forms as the current signup process / form is not a single step form, click signup square on this form [ http://festival.london2012.com/ ] \r\n\r\nI think there first needs to be a discussion with the Culture team about how these details are reformatted to fit into a single frame,. The Culture team should also be aware that the new form may function differently to the current form (in particular the user journey for users who already have a profile, as I understand it they will be asked to check their email where they will receive a link to the generic eDialog profile manager, rather than being able to signup in situ. Also how any input validation is handled as I expect this may also have to change. I will pick this up with Kate, but yes you’re right, the customer journey will probably have to change here from what it is currently. \r\n\r\nOnce that is decided then the Festival site will need to be re-coded to present the user with a email form (this will need a small amount of creative signed off) which doesn't cause the page to reload when submitted (unlike the above forms) after that the process of loading the iFrame should be very similar to the mechanism used above for the standard and business forms.\r\n\r\nIm not sure of exact timescales, but the Festival site is due to re-lauch this summer in a Phase II format. It may therefore make more sense to focus on at implementing the eDialog style forms into that version of the festival site (where you can have early input in the design / signup process) rather than trying to shoe-horn an eDialog/iFrame style sign form in place of the current multi step form. Does the area where the iframe will sit have different dimensions when phase II is launched? If so, then makes sense for us to develop with phase II in mind.\r\n\r\nI would expect it to be different, it is a much larger site, but AFAIK design work hasn't even started - we are not involved with the design, probably best if Kate (or Morag) speak with the Culture team and/or Wahome Muchiri [the project manger for the Festival site within the New Media team at LOCOG] who I have cc'd in) \r\n\r\n== Timescales \r\n\r\nIn terms of timescales (for part 1, the standard forms) we could centrally create a 'test' page (on the live or staging server) with a iFrame and a fixed url for the 10th (so that eDialog) could test the iFrame in situ *although* we would need another week (15th July) to implement the email signup box and to dynamically create the urls used to pull a page from eDialog into the iFrame. That’s fine.\r\n\r\nIn terms of switch over, do you have a time you are expecting to swap over as we'll need to work out a migartion strategy to re-map the old signup / register urls to the new page.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n \r\nJamie\r\n \r\nBefore committing to creating or updating the festival site (part 2). I think (if you haven't already done so) it may make sense to see how your timelines and the festival timelines overlap with regards to the Phase II site and then decide if it makes more sense to implement the eDialog signup functionality into that Phase II site (at the design stage) rather than trying to re-factor the current site (as I expect there will be small but non inconsequential implementation / refactoring issues here).\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited \r\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819\r\nThis E-mail is confidential.

I think the way to do this is to exclude any pages that are hidden from navigation, or not published.

The problem is Excel is trying to display it using the incorrect character set. We (like 99.9% of the web and products) use UTF-8 as it's standard compliment. Microsoft for some reason likes to use their own character encoding and worse still refuses to automatically open UTF-8 docs as UTF-8\n\nWe are not alone in this issue, Google is full of pages people discussing this issue, with no clear solution (at least none without other issues).\nhttp://www.myintervals.com/forum/discussion/280/making-csv-data-exports-with-utf8-more-excel-friendly/\n\nWe are outputting a completely valid UTF-8 .csv file the issue is Excel won't respect the character set.\n\nThe problem is that in order to get Excel to support UTF-8 CSV we have to change it to a TSV (tab separated) file and charge the charset to a superset of UTF-8 called UTF-16 Little Endian. But when you do that all your multiline content is stripped of line breaks.\n\nWhat can we / you do?\n\n- We can try and translate those chars, mainly MS curly quotes into normal quotes that will work in any western charset (this will initially give the impression that we have fixed the problem and is probably what most people do, but it this won't fix all characters, but will fix the worst offenders) \n- We can output a TSV file and charge the charset to UTF-16 (this is what Google docs do as is more correct than the above, but you will lose line breaks in multi line text)\n- We can export XML ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpreadsheetML ) which new versions of Excel will import instead (but you will need a newer version of Excel to open it; this is probably the cleanest way to fix the issue)\n- I think in the past we used a trick of setting the first few char in the document to a UTF-8 instruction code, this kind of wakes Excel up to the fact it's really an UTF-8 doc (going to refresh myself on this / see if it still works in newer versions of Excel)\n\nObviously if your editing the file in Excel then *this is an issue* but just wanted to point out that there is no 'quick fix' (that wont' have other consequences) we will however have a think about which if the above solutions is the lesser evil and get back to you.\n\nJamie\n\n* not much consolation, but if you open it in Google docs it will appear correctly, I'm not sure how much Google Docs handle the export to Excel (I expect they will have developed or licensed some expensive Excel import/export libraries)","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"attachments":[],"created_at":"2011/04/20 17:52:16 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"If you set the charset encoding of the web page to utf-8, and then Response.

In order to accommodate the additional 4m records from Ticketing, Kate has decided that she wants to bring forward the use of eDialog preference centre to serve as the main sign-up / preference management centre on london2012.com.\r\n\r\nInstead of London2012.com hosting sign-up / user management, we would host an iframe / link to the eDialog preference centre (skinned to look like our site).  A diagram is attached which shows how all the databases interrelate.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of implications for us, some of which are summarised below:\r\n\r\n1. We need to review phase 2 of our planned registration refactoring, as much of this will now not be required. Principally the intention is not to ask eDialog to reintegrate with the modified data feed, so that they can focus on setting up the preference centre (which probably won't be ready until September). This means that we need to do manual exports of unsubscribe / subscribe deltas in order to allow us to continue to conduct email campaigns. We will probably also hold fire on data purging from our system. \r\n\r\n2. The removal of a UMS from our system means that we won't be able to support any other logged in functionality - most notably commenting on blogs. I will talk to colleagues to find out how big a deal this is but I suspect not very. Please can you think about other ways in which we could approve commenting without a sign-in feature. The other possible area of functionality which we can't now support would be the mooted Festival 'favourites' list - but I don't think this was a very key feature.\r\n\r\n3. If we are moving to eDialog for sign-ups / preference management, we need to think about how this impacts the Festival sign-up and TAB sign-up pages.\r\n\r\nCan you think of any other consequences / implications we need to consider?\r\n\r\nKate is currently on leave but I suggest a call with her and eDialog on her return would be advisable.

brief round for internal review but would also\nappreciate your input. Are you able to provide feedback as tracked\nchanged and comments by COB tomorrow?\n\n\n\nDo please treat this confidentially – i.e. don’t discuss with Stamen\nif you’re in touch with them for any other reason – we haven’t yet\nbroached the subject with them.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nAndy\n\n\nFrom: Andy Watkins\nSent: 24 June 2011 14:53\nTo: Julie Dark; Wahome Muchiri; Deborah Hale; Jemma Thompson; Kika\nDabbs; Paul Bunnell; Aaron Shone; David Finch; Russ Ede\nCc: Alex Balfour; Liz Goulding; Morag Reavley; Nicola Peers; Davina\nGreen; #LOCOG New Media\nSubject: Tender Documentation for New Online Map\n\nAll,\n\nFor a number of reasons we have decided to replace the current\ninteractive map on the London 2012 website. A new mapping solution\nwill be procured that will replicate much of the functionality of the\nexisting map but also introduce new functionality required to support\ncritical campaigns such as Torch Relay and Festival 2012.\n\nAttached is the draft ITT. Could I ask you all to review the sections\npertinent to your area of responsibility and send me any questions and\ntracked feedback by close of business Tuesday, 28 June.
