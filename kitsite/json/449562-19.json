(as that is what we do for the normal user uploaded images) and then appearing in latest user uploads, which is totally wrong in both cases.\n\nWill see what I can do here, to be honest with you, had I known (and this is a leftover from Marna/I know we have been here before) I would never have let us allow images to be uploaded the way they are, as the backend UGC API's are geared up for accepting user uploaded images and not for images attached to an event. The problem was we had already started using it in this way and I was concerned that ripping it all out and starting again was going to cause more issues (in fact I should have just stopped that feature being used till we had a new backend built).\n\nI know the requirement seems really basic, but we have no off the shelf mechanism for letting users submit a front end form *with* an image attached so that the image and details comes though in the back end tied together (we also have the issue of how to allow you to approve/reject the image in the event editor itself). Had I known (and yes I should have kept a better eye on Marna and the requests she was agreeing to!) this was a serious requirement we would have proposed to construct the Event upload stuff totally differently (although it would have required a much larger amount of custom code, so possibly would have suggested that we ask users to just add a link to any assets/images they wanted us to use as an easy/cost effective workaround).\n\nIn short we're half way into the woods on this one and I wish I could get out as I feel I'm digging an even deeper hole ;-)\n\nAnyway, back to question at hand..\n\n- We'll add in some logic to stop pages being created for these images.\n- That should stop them appearing in 'latest' images.\n\nAs so for assigning, I think you should be able to assign the un-approved images in the Events' editor ie. you wont' need to approve them first and then as soon as the events get published the images wil get approved/published.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/07/12 14:24:10 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"No no, the images coming through for event pictures are just being ‘assigned’ to individual event pages.

I though we we;re already doing this)\n- I then identify and move all the OW images (regardless of status) into this new folder\n- We scrap any approve/reject workflow [attaching an image to an event is in effect approving it]\n- We then just reply on the fact that if you attach an image to a page and published it, the image gets published to.\n\n* The ideal would be to assign the image to the Event when we create the Event page, the problem here is that if we do that then when the event gets published the images goes with it / we have no way to approve reject the image in the events editor. We could work the other way round and assign the image and then rely on editors to clear any image they didn't want used?\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/07/12 14:48:11 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Ok this sounds good.

web01 from yesterday.\r\n\r\nhttp://213.120.228.148/\r\nhttp://213.120.228.149/\r\n\r\n(for SSH access we use 10.137.212.203  / 204 respectively; but only seem to have access from web01 atm)\r\n\r\nHowever the staging server is not a complete clone of the live server, specifically:\r\n\r\n- We have no domain names to use for name based virtual hosts, the server is simply delivery one site.\r\n- The httpd.conf is not a complete clone (partly due to the above), I have keep a diff of the files in /home/webcontent on stage03\r\n- SSL has not been set up on the staging servers (once again we need a domain to tie the cert to)\r\n- Some of the more specific rules in httpd.conf relating to Expired headers that are on the live site are not on the staging server yet\r\n\r\nIn short I have kept httpd.conf as simple and un modified as I can in order that a site can be delivered, I think we need a separate conversation re. how we much we want to keep the httpd.conf on the live servers in sync with the staging servers, what is required from our end to achieve this and finally who is responsible for updating, what is effectively a system config file, both now and going forward and what is the best way of managing this, do we create some scripts to auto generate the various versions? why writes and runs those scripts?\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nPrevious correspondence:\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI have synced /apps/apache/ from web01 so 10.137.212.203 (Olympic-stage03.btgs2-bt-locog) should now have a one off copy of whatever was on web01 when I ran the sync.\r\n\r\nThis is the command I used from web01:\r\n\r\nrsync -av --delete /apps/apache/ --exclude=*_log webcontent@10.137.212.203:/apps/apache/\r\n\r\nI have not synced from stage03 to stage04 (a modification of the above will work if this needs to be done)\r\n\r\nHowever we are unable to access either stage03 to stage04 via SSH/HTTP/HTTPS from our dev environment or our office router (we can do this on web01 and web02)\r\n\r\nThis is the list of IP's that need access:\r\n\r\n94.193.102.181 (kitsite office router)\r\n89.187.66.118 (milo.kitsite.com)\r\n89.187.66.113 (dev.kitsite.com)\r\n89.187.66.117 (koala.kitsite.com)\r\n89.187.66.120 (roo.kitsite.com)\r\n\r\nAdditionally  stage03 to stage04 should also allow outgoing connections to the above machines via SSH/HTTP/HTTPS\r\n\r\nUntil we can access the above machines via port 80 it is hard to test if the site has synced successfully.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI notice that we just have a sample Apache config file (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf)\r\n\r\nWe can create one that semi-reflects the live servers but it goes back to this issue of change control and who is responsible for system level config files?\r\n\r\nIn my experience the core Apache config file tends to be seen as part of the core system stack on a web server, with application level additions being added via additional config files or .htaccess files. This way is something breaks at the the app level, the includes can be commented out and the default configuration tested in isolation ie. a clear division of responsibility/ who's responsibility it is to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nMoving into a production environment I would say it is imperative that the 6 live and 2 staging servers all share a common server configuration file (where possible) that is generated 'on the fly' from a single master file, which is held in a version control system like SVN or Git and that this is normally seen as a task for the systems team.\r\n\r\nHowever if in the interests of just getting things moving ;-) if you want us to just set one up for the time being, could you get stage3.london2012.com and stage4.london2012.com setup as sub domains (I think Demy's do this?). That way we can add them as a ServerName which will make accessing them for testing easier.\r\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/06/29 12:08:48 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Jamie, can you just confirm: do you want us to bill 2 days just for this or does this include http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/1029?","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":false,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/07/07 16:26:06 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Hi Danny,\r\n\r\nThis is ticket 1029 ;) but the other ticket is for the integration of the server into the ongoing workflow at the moment we're just setting it up as a one time thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far:\r\n\r\n- Setup Apache httpd.conf on both servers\r\n- Synced a copy of the site from web01 to stage04\r\n- Setup domain names\r\n- Replaced all the base hrefs\r\n- Uploaded DSA_SLA_test_pages\r\n- Time spent researching, investigating and responding to emails\r\n- Setup Expires and ETags on staging servers\r\n- Synced staging servers\r\n\r\nAmongst other tasks, so far I have spent at least two days on this, but it's a bit of a rolling target / ticket..","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":false,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/07/26 12:15:36 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Marking as solved.","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/07/26 12:17:56 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Jamie, re my stupid comment: \"do you want us to bill 2 days just for this or does this include http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/1029?\"\r\n\r\nI meant http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/1030.","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":false,"author_id":3640926}],"latest_recipients":null,"due_date":"2010/07/02 12:00:00 +0100","current_collaborators":null,"status_id":4,"field_148059":"","description":"Setup staging server and copying across a one time sync of web01\r\n\r\n(there is a separate ticket dealing with integrating the two new staging servers into the existing publication work flow and modifying the rsync as ness.)","organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"2","assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","problem_id":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":9634933},{"channel":null,"nice_id":1113,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/07/21 11:25:20 +0100","field_358835":"","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0.2","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/07/20 14:44:28 +0100","resolution_time":140,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"authorized bill_separately","assignee_id":4323506,"updated_at":"2010/10/24 11:15:54 +0100","req_name":"Morag Reavley","linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2010/10/24 11:15:54 +0100","solved_at":"2010/07/26 10:35:05 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"bill_separately","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/07/22 17:40:14 +0100","score":0,"via_id":0,"subject":"Volunteering: Ordering of promos on Teams and roles page","recipient":null,"group_id":61946,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/07/20 14:44:28 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/20 14:44:28 +0100","ticket_id":15553869,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/07/21 10:15:21 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/22 18:25:38 +0100","ticket_id":15553869,"value":"0.2"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/07/20 14:44:28 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/20 14:44:28 +0100","ticket_id":15553869,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/07/20 14:44:28 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/21 10:15:21 +0100","ticket_id":15553869,"value":"bill_separately"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/07/20 14:44:28 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/20 14:44:28 +0100","ticket_id":15553869,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/07/21 10:15:21 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/26 10:35:05 +0100","ticket_id":15553869,"value":"0.2"}],"submitter_id":3692462,"base_score":0,"comments":[{"created_at":"2010/07/20 14:44:28 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"\r\nI'm really sorry to ask but I can't get hte promos to appear in alphabetical order on this page: http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/volunteer/games-maker-roles-and-venues/teams-and-roles/index.php \r\n\r\nThey should run in the same order as in the left hand nav.

If your asked 'Do you have a dietary requirement ' then people are less likely to tick it unless they 'have a real requirement'.
