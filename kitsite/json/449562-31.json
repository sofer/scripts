Any questions, please ask.\r\n\r\n* French ticket promo placeholder is double this size it should be\r\nForwarded to Lars: http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/668\r\n\r\n* Webcams not present\r\nAwaiting return from translations.com\r\n\r\n* Signup links in headers and footers go to English version of login / signup page\r\nI believe this is intentional - i.e. there are no French language login/signup pages.\r\n\r\n* No main promo (guessing that's cause the one that's in the \r\n* 'homepage banners' folder is marked as 'ready for translation'\r\n* and hasn't been published yet?)\r\nYou're correct in your diagnosis.\r\n\r\n* Lower-case ' i ' on 'investisseurs publics' in the bottom-left \r\n* corner'. Should be upper case if it's a title, I believe?\r\nFixed - although labels like this are fixable in the cms. I'm not sure whether Liz wants these requests to go via her. In any case, this particular one, I've fixed.\r\n\r\nParticiper hub\r\n\r\n* Actus appears twice (once in both sections) of the left-hand nav.\r\n* Unnecessary?\r\nJanos is currently looking at the LH nav. http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/669\r\n\r\n* «&nbsp formatting code visible in main text\r\nThis was actually returned to us by translations.com.\r\nAm investigating the extent of the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Search link in left-hand nav is confusing. Clicking it takes\r\n* you to a search results page (which is for no search term, \r\n* I think) where the first result contains English text. Is\r\n* it confusing having this as well as a search box in the \r\n* top-right of every page?\r\nRelated to the above - Janos investigating. http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/669\r\n\r\n\r\nMise en place hub\r\n\r\n* Broken link to L'héritage consécutif aux Jeux (guessing that's \r\n* cause the one that's in the 'homepage banners' folder is marked \r\n* as 'ready for translation' and hasn't been published yet?)\r\nOddly I can't see this, can you send a screenshot pls?\r\n\r\nLes Jeux hub\r\n\r\n* Sports olympiques in scrolling promos box isn't hyperlinked, \r\n* and corresponding picture links to English homepage\r\nFixed.\r\n\r\n* Sports olympiques and Sports paralympiques pull down buttons\r\n* say 'Go', and Sites button says 'Envoyer'. Inconsistent.\r\nWhat should they all be? \"Go\" or \"Envoyer\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following problems are really difficult for me to diagnose if I don't know which pages you're talking about. Even if the problem is evident on a lot of pages, one or two example URLs would be really helpful here. Could you send me some please? Just copy/paste from the browser location bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n===================\r\n\r\nGeneric content pages\r\n\r\n* Pulling in English news articles\r\n* Pulling in videos as related content when there will be no video section\r\n* Plenty of related photo captions are still in English\r\n\r\nGeneric hub pages\r\n\r\n* Pulling in videos as related content when there will be no video section\r\n* Navigational images in the main body of these pages don't appear to be linked to the pages they represent (they're not linked at all), but they are linked on the English site.\r\n* Plenty of related photo captions are still in English","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/03/10 16:51:46 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Regarding Kieran's comment: \"labels like this are fixable in the cms\", see http://postcms.zendesk.com/entries/114695-language-bundles for more information.\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/03/23 16:46:55 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"I have moved the second half of this conversation to:\r\n  http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/749\r\nand marked this ticket as solved.\r\nFyi, the billable time was split between Kieran & Janos.","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3663591}],"latest_recipients":"Liz.Goulding@london2012.com support+id82@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":"Liz Goulding","status_id":4,"field_148059":"authorized","description":"Boiler-plate code that can be inserted into a template to prevent it being sent for translation, perhaps.\r\n\r\nFeedback (i.e. \"This page has NOT been sent for translation\") would also be useful.","organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"0.5","assignee_name":"Kieran Topping","problem_id":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692462}]
