But I'm pretty sure the problem can be reproduced like this:\r\n1) open a page for editing and select some text to link\r\n2) click the \"Link\" tool \r\n3) as soon as the picker has loaded, swap to the browse panel (ie. before it's had a chance to load \"quick search\" results)\r\n4) you get a blank results panel.\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to disable the mode buttons until the initial result load is finished. But obv that's not a very good fix! Would be better if it just worked smoothly if the user follows these steps. I guess if you check in the success handler for whether the mode has changed this will be fairly straightforward.","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3635967},{"created_at":"2009/10/22 16:41:06 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"I can't reproduce this for the first try, but on ie8 the whole dialog box disappears when i try to switch to browse panel. also there are couple of javascript error for each click (ie7 & 8). trying again on a native box.","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":4323506},{"created_at":"2010/04/14 11:07:20 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Debs, can you confirm whether or not this is still a problem for you (specifically in IE8).","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/04/15 11:21:22 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Yesterday the problem occurred in IE8, as reported\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692169},{"created_at":"2010/04/15 11:33:41 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"IE8 can reproduce this - looking at it now.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":4323506},{"created_at":"2010/04/15 12:14:04 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Actually, can reproduce on live and can't on dev.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":4323506},{"created_at":"2010/04/26 12:33:54 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":19,"value":"This ticket was closed and merged into ticket #855 \"IE8 issues consolidated\".","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":4323506}],"linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2010/04/26 12:33:54 +0100","solved_at":"2010/04/26 12:33:54 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2009/10/22 15:36:48 +0100","channel":null,"via_id":4,"subject":"Picker shows blank browse panel","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","group_id":45601,"submitter_id":3692169,"base_score":0,"latest_recipients":"support+id166@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2009/10/22 10:49:29 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/14 11:07:19 +0100","ticket_id":4509350,"value":"ie8"},{"ticket_field_id":96134,"created_at":"2009/10/22 10:49:29 +0100","updated_at":"2009/10/22 10:49:29 +0100","ticket_id":4509350,"value":"bug"},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2009/10/22 10:49:29 +0100","updated_at":"2009/10/22 10:49:29 +0100","ticket_id":4509350,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":99758,"created_at":"2009/10/22 10:49:29 +0100","updated_at":"2009/10/22 10:49:29 +0100","ticket_id":4509350,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2009/10/22 10:49:29 +0100","updated_at":"2009/10/22 10:49:29 +0100","ticket_id":4509350,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/04/14 11:07:19 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/14 11:07:19 +0100","ticket_id":4509350,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/04/14 11:07:19 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/14 11:07:19 +0100","ticket_id":4509350,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/04/14 11:07:20 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/14 11:07:20 +0100","ticket_id":4509350,"value":null}],"status_id":4,"field_148059":"","description":"When I'm trying to search within the folder structure to link to a page\nit's not giving me the full list:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDeborah Elstein\n\n \n\nCopywriter\n\nCommunications team, LOCOG\n\nDirect line: +44 (0)20 3 2012 109\n\n \n\n\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n \nThis E-mail is confidential.
