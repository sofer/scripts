We thought we had cleaned these up and informed the translation company but will double check to see if it is still happening anywhere.\r\n\r\nIf the refereeing page/section is possible guessable ie. requests for .js or images within the /photo or /webcams section you could go at look at a selection of those pages (you only need to look at one page of each type) to see if you can spot any broken referrers just using a tool like Firebug on Firefox (too see what assets are/aren't loading). Although having just done this on both the webcam and image hubs and the pages themselves I can't see any issues / broken paths. Although that's not to say there aren't issues on other pages/\r\n\r\nWith regards to resolving the rest of them I think we really need to see the REFERER pages or else we are looking for a needle in a haystack, to make matters worse some of these requests may be from old cached copied of pages, requests from robots scraping the page (but not doing so properly and hence garbling urls).\r\n\r\nIf we know on which page these requests are coming from we can then check those pages and if a path is broken quickly fix it. \r\n\r\nAlthough we may find that many of these 404 are direct requests by a robot or script (which has ignored the 'base href' tag and so is looking for paths relatively to a page and not the root of the site) or from cached copies of old pages.\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\nOn 17 Aug 2010, at 10:08, Nagalakshmi Musunuri wrote:\r\n\r\nHi Danny/Jamie,\r\n\r\nBT has been noticing 404 errors on www.london2012.com and they have become increasingly concerned since they are currently planning to migrate all applications to new BT infrastructure under managed services.

Once it is \"published\" (which should more accurately be known as \"queued for publication\", it then takes a minute or so for the cms to actually promote it to the live servers. There is then a synchronisation process (which Kitsite has no control over) which can then take up to 5 minutes to push the updates across all of the live servers. The upshot is that - even if scheduling was working perfectly - your page would not have appeared on the live site for up to 5 or 6 minutes (sometimes even longer, at busy times).\r\nThe next time you schedule a page for publication could you let us know before you do it please, so that someone can (virtually!) look over your shoulder to see what is going wrong.\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nKieran\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/08/17 10:54:31 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":19,"value":"This ticket was closed and merged into ticket #1165 \"Re: Scheduling in the CMS\".","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591}],"linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":0,"status_updated_at":"2010/08/17 10:54:31 +0100","solved_at":"2010/08/17 10:54:31 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/08/17 10:54:31 +0100","channel":null,"via_id":4,"subject":"Lee Valley White Water Centre video scheduled to be published","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","group_id":61946,"submitter_id":8189631,"base_score":0,"latest_recipients":"support+id1170@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/08/17 09:31:24 +0100","updated_at":"2010/08/17 09:31:24 +0100","ticket_id":17546422,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/08/17 10:25:48 +0100","updated_at":"2010/08/17 10:25:48 +0100","ticket_id":17546422,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/08/17 09:31:24 +0100","updated_at":"2010/08/17 09:31:24 +0100","ticket_id":17546422,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/08/17 09:31:24 +0100","updated_at":"2010/08/17 09:31:24 +0100","ticket_id":17546422,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/08/17 09:31:24 +0100","updated_at":"2010/08/17 09:31:24 +0100","ticket_id":17546422,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/08/17 10:25:48 +0100","updated_at":"2010/08/17 10:25:48 +0100","ticket_id":17546422,"value":null}],"status_id":4,"field_148059":"","description":"Hi Guys \n\n \n\nI just wanted to let you know that I have scheduled the Lee Valley White\nWater Centre video to be published at 10.00. \n\n \n\nIf it doesn't work I will have to publish it manually. \n\n \n\nThanks\n\nUzma. \n\n \n\nUzma Khan\n\nCommunications Assistant  \n\nCommunications  \n\nDirect line: 020 3023 6927\n\n \n\nOlympic Delivery Authority\n\nMailpoint: 7a\n\n23rd Floor, One Churchill Place\n\nLondon E14 5LN\n\n \n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\n\nwww.london2012.com  \n\n \n\nFind out what is going on at London 2012 HQ - http://blog.london2012.com\n \n\n \n\n*\n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email\n\n \n\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">This email and any attachments are for the attention of the addressee(s) only.\nIt may also be confidential.

As I understand it if a web server is down the Load Balancer won't send traffic to a dead server (so we should be fine), although I am not 100% confident of this (may be worth checking with BT). As the cert is tied to a domain name / the csr and the staging server is not currently setup as an exact clone of the live servers we can't properly test it on the staging environment first.

Still investigating. One suspect here is some JS (for example a image carousel) that loops though images inside a given <div> tag, by appending a filename to a set path ie. \"/image/location\" + \"image1.jpg\" if there is no image then the code will try to retrieve the folder alone. Obviously where we have written any JS code that has this issue we can fix it. But a lot of the JS on the site was supplied by CogApp / McCann as self contained libraries. Obviously we are trying to gather as much info here as possible as this seems the biggest source of 404's\r\n\r\nStatus: open, moved to new/seperate ticket\r\n\r\n2) /ntytwelve (fixed) this was a broken path to an externally hosted video pasted in buy the editorial team; it was missing the [ http://89.234.19.19/twe ] bit and so was looking for the file locally.
