First instalment:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. No related photos at all any more?\r\nThere were no related photos appearing. This was because the CMS was looking for French-language photo pages (of which we have none). I have amended the code so that it - instead - looks for English-language photo pages. We will need to republish the French section in order for this to take effect on the live site. However, for the meantime you can confirm it's working in the CMS here:\r\n  http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/fr/news/2009/11/le-cio-est-tres-positif-au-sujet-de-l-avancement-des-travaux-de-londres-2012.php\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Top nav section 'Séjour' is listed as 'Visitier en 2012' in all breadcrumbs for that section\r\nThis is an upshot of the fact that it was felt that there was a need to shorten\r\n\"Visiter en 2012\" to \"Séjour\" in the top nav. If this means that the whole\r\nsection needs to be renamed \"Séjour\" then ... that is fine, but it's not my call\r\n- in fact it's probably not even your call (as such) but a question for\r\ntranslatios.com. The question(s) specifically being:\r\n a) Is it appropriate to entitle the section \"Séjour\", and for it to appear as\r\n such in the breadcrumb.\r\n b) If so, and if it is appropriate, can they undertake to always translate \"Visiting in 2012\" as \"Séjour\".\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1 http://www.london2012.com/fr/photos/ Search box and button in right-hand column are in English\r\nThe Search box has been fixed. The search \"button\" is in fact a gif.\r\nThe button is a gif. See:\r\n http://www.london2012.com/images/presentation/search-blue-on-white.gif.\r\nCan we request a French language gif from you? Presumably saying \"Rechercher\".\r\n\r\n3.2 Your photos\r\nWe are unclear what you would like to do with the \"Your photos\" links. Should\r\nthey simply be disabled (they're pointing to English-language pages)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. http://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/planning-consultations/index.php Text in body doesn't point out that Greenwich Park and Earl's Court consultation sites are in English only\r\nThis is because the English language page contains hard-coded links to pages. i.e. links that have been chosen by directly specifying an entire url in the link-picker (one of which - in fact - is a short url). As such, these links are NOT under content management, so we have no simple way of knowing that we should display an \"(en anglais uniquement)\" disclaimer. \r\n\r\nIf necessary, we can search for other such occurrences, and provide you with a list, so they can be manually fixed. However, I think that this is outside of the immediate scope of the French site. Please correct me if I'm wrong here.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. http://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environmental-monitoring/rapports-de-surveillance.php: text doesn't highlight that reports are in english\r\nIf you're talking about the following links:\r\n   http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ \"Hackney\"\r\n   http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/ \"Tower Hamlets\"\r\n   http://www.walthamforest.gov.uk/ \"Waltham Forest\"\r\n   http://www.newham.gov.uk/ \"Newham\"\r\nthen we don't really have a way of knowing whether any particular editorially-chosen external link is in French or English. This might be something that you might want to direct Translations.com to do? i.e. to \"Examine any external links and - if they're English-only, then append \"(en anglais uniquement)\".

In fact, here is the list:\r\n http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/fr/about-us/the-people-delivering-the-games/the-london-organising-committee/le-bureau-du-locog.php\r\n http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environmental-monitoring/bruit.php\r\n http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environmental-monitoring/poussiere.php\r\n http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/fr/visiting/accommodation/index.php\r\n http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/fr/visiting/safety-and-security/index.php\r\nWhich contain the following alt text\r\n\tApplying water to materials during demolition\r\n\tBuilding noise screens\r\n\tCrusher\r\n\tDampening down the site roads\r\n\tGenerator\r\n\tHard-surfacing roads\r\n\thrh the princess royal\r\n\tMinimising dust on the Olympic Park\r\n\tOfficers walking in front of Big Ben\r\n\tRoad sweeper\r\n\tUsing water at exits\r\n\tVegetation on the Park to minimise dust\r\n\tVibration\r\n\tWheel washers\r\n\tcharles allen\r\n\tcraig reedie\r\n\tjonathan edwards\r\n\tkeith mills\r\n\tmohammed bari\r\n\tneil wood\r\n\tphil craven\r\n\tseb coe\r\nThe last 8 are obviously names and so need no translation, so it's only the first 14 that we need translations for. Liz,Finn, can you forward these to Lina, requesting translation please? Or can I do this?\r\n\r\n7. http://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/infrastructure/technologie.php: empty apart from main picture, this page is populated on the English site though\r\n\r\nFor some reason translations.com were sent an empty file. I don't know exactly why this happened and am investigating. In the meantime, I have resent it for translation (and confirmed that it contains the body text!).\r\n\r\n8. http://www.london2012.com/fr/games/: No Venues in pull down list, http://www.london2012.com/fr/games/venues/index.php: No venues present on page, just categories of venues\r\n\r\nThe Venue pages are still with Translations.com.

Attempting to cover things here, point me towards a different ticket please if need be?\n\nRe: 3) I'll get that gif sorted on Monday. Re: 7) do translations.com need a reminder from us?\n\nLiz - some stuff to decide on, summarised for you below:\n\n1) Here is a list of pages where alt tags on embedded images didn't come back translated into French from translations.com\n\n- http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/fr/about-us/the-people-delivering-the-games/the-london-organising-committee/le-bureau-du-locog.php\n- http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environmental-monitoring/bruit.php\n- http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environmental-monitoring/poussiere.php\n- http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/fr/visiting/accommodation/index.php\n- http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/fr/visiting/safety-and-security/index.php\n\nThe images on these pages contain the following alt-text which needs translating:\n\n Applying water to materials during demolition\n Building noise screens\n Crusher\n Dampening down the site roads\n Generator\n Hard-surfacing roads\n hrh the princess royal\n Minimising dust on the Olympic Park\n Officers walking in front of Big Ben\n Road sweeper\n Using water at exits\n Vegetation on the Park to minimise dust\n Vibration\n Wheel washers\n\nKieran has asked if it's cool for him to forward these to Translations.com for translating. I figure the answer is almost definitely yes but I'm unaware of how they charge us so wanted to get the go-ahead from you.\n\n2) Did translations.com decide whether we should change the section 'visitier en 2012' to 'sejour?'. If it's any use, this discussion stemmed from me finding that the breadcrumbs for the 'sejour' section all display as 'visitier en 2012'\n\nKieran said:\n\nThis is an upshot of the fact that it was felt that there was a need to shorten \"Visiter en 2012\" to \"Séjour\" in the top nav. If this means that the whole section needs to be renamed \"Séjour\" then ... that is fine, but it's not my call - in fact it's probably not even your call (as such) but a question for translatios.com. The question(s) specifically being:\n\na) Is it appropriate to entitle the section \"Séjour\", and for it to appear as such in the breadcrumb.\n\nb) If so, and if it is appropriate, can they undertake to always translate \"Visiting in 2012\" as \"Séjour\".\n\n3) Is it ok for Kieran to send the Paralympic pages for translation? 20 pages in total.\n\n-----Original Message-----\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3734551},{"created_at":"2010/05/11 16:04:39 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Each French issue now has its own ticket.\r\nI have created new tickets for each of Morag's issues (but not for the ones in this here ticket - If there are any outstanding/serious issues in this ticket, please raise a new ticket - one per issue).\r\nThanks, Kieran\r\n(No days allocated to this ticket, as it has been billed for elsewhere).","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591}],"linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2010/08/09 16:17:28 +0100","solved_at":"2010/05/11 16:04:39 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/03/15 16:09:05 +0000","channel":null,"via_id":0,"subject":"French site amendments","recipient":null,"group_id":61946,"submitter_id":4323506,"base_score":0,"latest_recipients":"support+id687@postcms.zendesk.com Liz.Goulding@london2012.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","ticket_id":8977683,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","updated_at":"2010/05/11 16:04:22 +0100","ticket_id":8977683,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","ticket_id":8977683,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","ticket_id":8977683,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","ticket_id":8977683,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","updated_at":"2010/05/11 16:04:23 +0100","ticket_id":8977683,"value":"0"}],"status_id":4,"field_148059":"","description":"Hi Janos, plenty more amendments required please\r\n\r\nGeneral stuff\r\n\r\n- No related photos at all anymore?\r\n\r\n- Top nav section 'Sejour' is listed as 'Visitier en 2012' in all \r\nbreadcrumbs for that section\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/photos/\r\n\r\n- search box and button in right-hand column are in English\r\n\r\n- your photos\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/planning-consultations/ind \r\nex.php\r\n\r\n- Text in body doesn't point out that Greenwich Park and Earl's Court \r\nconsultation sites are in English only\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environment \r\nal-monitoring/bruit.php\r\n\r\n- alt tags in pictures in body in english\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environment \r\nal-monitoring/poussiere.php\r\n\r\n- alt tags in pictures in body in english\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environment \r\nal-monitoring/rapports-de-surveillance.php\r\n\r\n- text doesn't highlight that reports are in english\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/infrastructure/technologie \r\n.php\r\n\r\n- empty apart from main picture, this page is populated on the English \r\nsite though\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/\r\n\r\n- No Venues in pull down list\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/venues/index.php\r\n\r\n- No venues present on page, just categories of venues\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/olympic-sports/index.php\r\n\r\n- Olympic sports not in alphabetical order (E's at the end)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/olympic-sports/badminton.php\r\n\r\n- 'Qui' pictures not corresponding to information (picture of man is \r\nAnthony Clark, not Susan Susanti')\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/olympic-sports/boxe.php\r\n\r\n- Same, picture of Bradley Saunders listed as being Muhammed Ali.

If we put a summary line in a new field called 'strapline' it wont' be picked up anywhere.\r\n\r\nAt the moment we can just ignore it, but would be best to remove the strapline completely and make the OW team aware that the 'one sentence/strapline' is actually the description field in the CMS.\r\n\r\nLet me know if it is safe to remove the strap line.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\nps. if you look at the two fields in the attached screenshot you'll see that the two fields are being export separately, but this is a red herring, it's simply because the two fields both get populated with the same data when an event is submitted.
