From their test's what they believe is happening is that the images are going to the FTP and into Kitsite but the metadata isn't transferring and that is what is getting stuck on the FTP. Therefore the image goes into Kitsite but had no metadata attached.\n\n\n\nThe FTP has been cleared - so I will keep an eye on the image that is there at the moment and see if it gets through. Perhaps we can remedy this by logging in and clearing the FTP as and when an image appears to get stuck.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nJustin.\n\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3709935},{"created_at":"2011/05/18 18:37:42 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"OK.

Some text was also slightly adjusted to fir on screen. If you can get me the image for Get Involved that would be great and can link that to the page- text probably would have to be blue and same size as rest of page to keep with brand consistency.

And then use an image below.\n\nAre we going to just use 3 images in the slide show part of the new website (the pictures under the title New open weekend hub')? If so, you could use one of the other images we had previously sent through (there were 5 I think?). But if not could we use the image which is currently on the old OW site on the left (with the athlete and the cyclists in black).\n[cid:image001.png@01CC1ABE.942E4330]\n\nFrom: Zara Rabinowicz\nSent: 23 May 2011 15:45\nTo: Caroline Hadfield\nSubject: RE: OW page\n\nHi Caroline\n\nThat sounds completely fine, if you can get a graphic together for that, I can implement it.\n\nCheers\nZara\n\nFrom: Caroline Hadfield\nSent: 23 May 2011 15:00\nTo: Zara Rabinowicz\nSubject: RE: OW page\n\nHi Zara,\n\nThis looks great so far!\n\nIn terms of the space of the second BP logo, ideally we would like to have a header which says something like: 'Get involved now' or 'What's going on for Open weekend near you?' which you could click on and then this would take you to the full listings/the map.

Some text was also slightly adjusted to fir on screen. If you can get me the image for Get Involved that would be great and can link that to the page- text probably would have to be blue and same size as rest of page to keep with brand consistency. Once I get that over from you I'll look at implementing extra changes,\n\nCheers\nZara\n\nFrom: Caroline Hadfield\nSent: 24 May 2011 11:07\nTo: Zara Rabinowicz\nSubject: RE: OW page\n\nHi Zara,\n\nWe would like to use the text 'Get involved now' preferably in a font size that will stand out. And then use an image below.\n\nAre we going to just use 3 images in the slide show part of the new website (the pictures under the title New open weekend hub')? If so, you could use one of the other images we had previously sent through (there were 5 I think?). But if not could we use the image which is currently on the old OW site on the left (with the athlete and the cyclists in black).\n[cid:image001.png@01CC1ABE.942E4330]\n\nFrom: Zara Rabinowicz\nSent: 23 May 2011 15:45\nTo: Caroline Hadfield\nSubject: RE: OW page\n\nHi Caroline\n\nThat sounds completely fine, if you can get a graphic together for that, I can implement it.\n\nCheers\nZara\n\nFrom: Caroline Hadfield\nSent: 23 May 2011 15:00\nTo: Zara Rabinowicz\nSubject: RE: OW page\n\nHi Zara,\n\nThis looks great so far!\n\nIn terms of the space of the second BP logo, ideally we would like to have a header which says something like: 'Get involved now' or 'What's going on for Open weekend near you?' which you could click on and then this would take you to the full listings/the map.

One for CogApp if you need that header section to be linkable.\r\n\r\n- Nav: News nav (and nav in general) doesn't wrap (see screenshot) this may be an issue with long headlines in the news section. Sorry more an observation than a suggested fix.\r\n\r\n- Sponsors links: as the number of logos increased/decreases their will be an issue with white boxes on the logos as they overlay the background img (see screenshot)\r\n\r\nOther minor tweaks that it would be better to get CogApp to make (esp. if they are looking at above issues anyway).\r\n\r\n- Home: H2 headlines are not links \r\n- Content: add (optional) dateline (so can be reused for news stories)\r\n\r\nOther clarifications (to Danny post)\r\n\r\n - Hub: Teams and Competitors are likely to get mixed up in the (alphabetical) navigation \r\nThis may not be an issue if each folder keeps to one kind of 'thing' ie. a teams section or a competitors section, it's if/when you want to mix types of pages you'll hit issues or if you envision subfolders of top level folders (do you?). We can always let you hide pages from navigation which may be enough. More flagging it up FYI as last minute navigation changes will be hard/expensive to make (unless told otherwise, we are just going to code that nav to list any page sin the current section that don't have the hide tick box ticked).\r\n\r\n- All: The event title at the top of the page is an image that will need to be created for each new event \r\nThis is a JPG it falls back to tex but obv. you'll need a new img for each event (it's here in the Cogapp folder /locog/images/test-sites/heading.gif)\r\n\r\n- Content page layout: some of the elements in the body (e.g. pullquotes) may be tricky to do. \r\nThe CMS won't allow you to drop \"pull quotes\" in the middle of a block of body of text. We could code up the exact example layout but that will mean the second section having 3 separate body fields. We tend not to do that elsewhere, but you may be OK with it for this site (basically you'll have to split your single article into 3 block manually)\r\n\r\n- News hub: need some clarification on the logic here, assume everything is News as it has a date, do we just pull in the latest 5 news stories into the slots on that page. Is the last block intentionally 3 rather than 4? \r\n\r\n- News hub images: if we are pulling images across automatically we need to designate an image on the Content page to pull from and this has to be a static image on the page (not one embedded in a rich text container) see 'Content page layout' issue above. Also wanted to check if you think there will be issue with auto cropping to a small square? This will be an issue if you have lots of head shots as the auto crop isn't cleaver enough to perfectly crop someones head out of a larger photo!\r\n\r\nI think that's it (do take a look at Danny comment as well)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/04/11 10:15:27 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi Jamie / Lars, I think Danny said he's away from today, here are responses to what he's said here. Can you let me know if you need more info and action ASAP please?\r\n\r\nIssues to refer to Cogapp:\r\n\r\nDO ANY OF THE ISSUES BELOW ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE REFERRED TO COGAPP? OR ARE THEY THINGS THAT YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO INTERNALLY? WASN'T AWARE THEY'D NEED PASSING BACK TO COGAPP, THAT'S GONNA DELAY US A LITTLE...\r\n\r\n    - Home: The caption isn't a HREF (also can't immediately see how the link is assigned to the image wither) and if we make it a href the caption turns blue\r\n\r\n GOT THE IMPRESSION IT WASN'T TOO DIFFICULT TO ADD THIS, ASSUME IT'S REFERRING TO THE CAPTION UNDER THE SCROLLING PROMO IMAGE SPACE\r\n\r\n    - Nav: News nav (and nav in general) doesn't wrap, this may be an issue with long headlines in the news section.\r\n\r\nDON'T UNDERSTAND THE SPECIFICS OF THIS I'M AFRAID, NOT SOMETHING DANNY AND I DISCUSSED. IS THIS REFERRING TO THE LEFT-HAND NAV, AND IS IT SUGGESTING NEWS HEADLINES CAN'T BE ANY LONGER THAN THE WIDTH OF THE LEFT-HAND NAV BOX?\r\n\r\n    - Sponsors links: as the number of logos increased/decreases their will be an issue with white boxes on the logos as they overlay the background img.\r\n\r\nI THINK THIS REFERS TO THE DISCUSSION DANNY AND I HAD ABOUT WHETHER THE 'SPONSORS' SPACE ABOVE THE FOOTER WILL LOOK ODD IF THERE AREN'T MANY LOGOS IN IT. THE SOLUTION WE DISCUSSED WAS THAT WHERE YOU HAVE 'SPONSORS' AND LOGOS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE BRANDED BLUE AND PURPLE CIRCLES COULD REMAIN THE SAME (WE'RE NOT EXPECTING MORE THAN FOUR SPONSORS FOR ANY EVENT). ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE, PLEASE COULD WE ADD AN EDITIBLE SPACE TO DISPLAY A WORD ABOVE THE LOGOS AS 'SPONSORS' IS DISPLAYED ON THE LEFT? IT'S MOST LIKELY GOING TO NEED TO SAY 'INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION' (E.G. INTERNATIONAL ATHLETICS FEDERATION) AND HAVE THEIR LOGO BELOW IT. \r\n\r\n    - Home: H2 headlines are not links\r\n\r\nDO-ABLE?\r\n\r\n    - Content: add (optional) dateline (so can be reused for news stories)\r\n\r\nDANNY'S SUGGESTION WAS THAT WE ARE GOING TO USE A VERY SLIGHTLY AMENDED VERSION OF THE 'CONTENT' TEMPLATE PROVIDED BY COGAPP FOR FULL NEWS ARTICLES (E.G.

These change may appear trivial (and indeed it may be trivial). But we have had several cases recently where we have spent a disappropriate amount of time trying to make what were initially seemingly small CSS or JS tweaks (for example we change a CSS style for the home page and then find out that it's causes another link to turn blue elsewhere on IE7 for some odd reason and spend a day debugging it while up against a deadline). As we haven't started coding the site in earnest yet it seems to make sense to get the HTML/CSS as you want it before we start implementing it. My concern is that if we try and make changes and then at the last minute someone spots that that is throwing up a issue we'll be trying to fix them issue just prior to launch.\n\n- HREF: the caption isn't a link, if we make it a link it gets the wrong style (see above)\n\n- H2 Headlines: Doable but need CogApp to update the CSS as they currently turn blue when made links (unless this is what you want) (see screenshot)\n\n- Nav /News nav: exactly the text wraps but maybe not the way you expect (see screenshots). If your OK with the way it looks (and maybe that was how it was designed) then there is no problem.\n\n- Sponsors: if you want four sponsors on the left you'll hit an issue with the fourth one overlaying the background (see screenshot - issues with Sainsbury logo) - solution: get Cogapp to make the middle image smaller?\n\n- Sponsors right: The images don't naturally align right, see attached screenshot:  solution: get Cogapp to make the right hand side images align right (if less than 3) or assign a blank image to unused spots.\n\n- Sponsors right text: can we get Cogapp to add this extra text box in if they are making the above changes (the text box is easy, getting it to always align right can be tricky or may require more than just an align:right tag)\n\n- \"News: need to decide on best way to get images that fit\" I what Danny is referring to is how images are assigned re. the layout of then news page and whether you are expecting those elements (images/pull quotes) to flow 'in line' or if you want the layout fixed exactly as it is in the design. The downside to using inline images is that the images will have to be resized manually, you may hit issues with getting the exact layout you expect exactly right (depending on content length) and you can't have pull quotes. The downside to having a fixed layout is that it will be fixed and made up of multiple text boxes (although on thsi site that may be the preferable option).\n\nAll the rest sounds fine.\n\nthanks\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/04/11 11:50:14 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Jamie, all clear and really helpful, ta.

We are really quite keen to look at the wider issues around registration that the usability audit has brought up, but I don't think we can get this all resolved by next week.\r\n\r\n1. \"Rather than use bullets [radio buttons] to determine between new and existing account holders, split the two options up clearly as shown in the example below\".\r\nThis looks like a sensible suggestion that is relevant to all classes of users and could probably be implemented relatively simply. Should be doable by next Thursday.\r\n\r\n2. \"Make this form specific to TAB updates and provide a more general email update form accessed from the global navigation\"\r\nThis would require us to build and maintain two forms and with them all the associated code that checks the input, returns users to the correct page and updates the user database. We also need to work out what to do with returning users and which form to redirect them to for updating their details--if indeed you still want that functionality. this is not a short piece of work and should probably not be implemented before we have a wider review of the way registration works. Unlikely to be done by next week.\r\n\r\n3. \"Only include essential fields, this form should be about signing up for travel advice so collect only the required data to return this information\"\r\nWe could make certain fields optional, but we could not easily make them optional in one context and compulsory in another--at least not without a bit of re-factoring and possibly a separation of forms as mooted above. So, if the change is universal, we can do that before next week; if it is specific to business users, then we almost certainly cannot.\r\n\r\n4. \"As the users will predominantly be from UK companies, ensure this is at the top of the list\"\r\nThis looks pretty trivial. before next week, I would hope.\r\n\r\n5. \"It is anticipated that most users will not be leaving blog posts so create a separate form for those wishing to do so\"\r\nQuite so. This is true for non-business users, too. Wider discussion needed. Probably not fixable for next week.\r\n\r\n6. \"Ensure the form complies with W3C accessibility guidelines and is fully supporting of navigation via tabbing\"\r\nThis is an issue for all users, not just business users.
