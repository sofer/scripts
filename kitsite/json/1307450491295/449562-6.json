More specifically, some of the changes I have made to events on the map are causing it to behave strangely and create duplicate events.\n\nFor example, as the screenshot below shows, there was an event in October 2010 at the Olympic Park. When this event was initially created in our system, there were errors in the text (eg. 'familly', as below).  I went into this document last week and made a few amendments. I then republished the event, but instead of just updating with my changes, it created a duplicate event. This means that, as the screenshot shows, there are now two articles for this event: one of which is the original version, which still has the spelling error (no. 1 below), and then also my corrected version from last week (no. 2 below).\n\nI'm not really sure how to go about fixing this problem, as there is only one item in CMS which is displaying all of the information correctly.

When this event was initially created in our system, there were errors in the text (eg. 'familly', as below).  I went into this document last week and made a few amendments. I then republished the event, but instead of just updating with my changes, it created a duplicate event.
