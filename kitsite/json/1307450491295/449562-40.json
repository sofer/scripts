We already minimise libraries where the biggest savings can be made.\r\n\r\n3) *BUT* we do have a solution that solves the above, it will involve some small development work but will minimise disruption to workflow and offer lots of advantages (basically we are going to suggest that we merge and compress the CSS and JS into two respective files at delivery time with a caching mechanism)\r\n\r\nAgain *Don't feed this back to ITS* I feel like there is probably enough antagonism already and I certainly don't want to stoke the fire!! \r\n\r\nBut our feeling is that we can do *lots of things* to improve the speed of the site (especially if starting from scratch) and are happy to do so (I imagine we can suggest lots of things ITS haven't even thought of themselves). There are also things you can ask for when commissioning new designs and internally when creating new images, which will make the biggest savings of all.\r\n\r\nBut I think is slightly unfair of ITS with no understanding of the site, workflow, our role/remit, legacy of how we we're supplied code (and the time scales we worked to once delivered that code, ie. no time to say \"errm, this could be slightly more efficient\") to ask us to make changes without understanding their impact.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's not my place to say this, but I feel this could have been so better handled by initially asking to talk to us to understand why certain things are as they are and how they can be improved both now and in future. Rather than getting hung up on minimising CSS and JS files, as if we are unaware of the possibility of doing this (which TBH we fund rather patronising).\r\n\r\nWe do really clever stuff in the CMS (and other sites) with regards to reducing the footprint of CSS and JS files, but in these cases we are talking about minimising ~700k Javascript and CSS files down to a quarter of that size, which is a *real* saving (when we're trying to keep the 'total page' weight to under ~250k). We also have a different workflow in terms of how those JS and CSS files get generated. We also deliver all the icons as sprites, but once again those are never updated editorially. We also have clever cache headers and intelligent ETags in the CMS. But we have never been asked to implement these cache based performance optimisations on the 2012 site. Although in fact *we do keep an overview on things like this out of good will*. In fact only last week I fixed the Apache ETags on the live BT servers (and didn't charge you for it) which fixed an issue with the ETag's being output incorrectly making the pages largely un-cacheable (driving up your bandwidth bill and users download times).\r\n\r\nIf you'd like us to suggest more things like this in future then we're happy to so pre-emptily, maybe it is our fault in that we should have hassled you more in terms of \"We think the way this JS/CSS as supplied is less than optimal\" or \"We could improve your cache headers\" (but in truth the site didn't seem to have performance or bandwidth issues so we figured this was of a lower priority for now).\r\n\r\nMy point is we can sit down and have a really mature conversation around where we can make optimisations and whether they are better made now or as part of a new future redesign. Additionally knowing the site and CMS as we do we also can make some real world suggestions that may not have been thought about.\r\n\r\nFor a start no one at ITS has even mentioned Expired headers and an intelligent caching strategy (we have never built one as we assumed as the web host this was BT job, but more than happy to plan one out for you). This would *substantially reduce bandwidth* as all images and assets would  be cached down stream by a CDN or local ISP.\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/02/16 14:17:39 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Jamie,\n\n \n\nAll your work/thoughts around this are appreciated, and I agree with the\nsuggested approach/handling of this in future!

It seems\nto crash my whole computer.\n\n\nWould you be able to check whether you can edit it or whether it is my\nmachine?\n\n \n\nThanks\n\n\nAlex\n\n \n\n \n\nAlexandra Brown\n\nMarketing Executive (New Media)\n\nCommunications\n\n \n\nOlympic Delivery Authority\n\nMailpoint: 7A\n\n23rd Floor, One Churchill Place\n\nLondon E14 5LN\n\n \n\nDirect line: +44 (0) 203 023 6016\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\n\nwww.london2012.com  \n\n \n\n \n\nFind out what is going on at London 2012 HQ - http://blog.london2012.com\n\n \n\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">This email message has been scanned for viruses by Mimecast.\nMimecast delivers a complete managed email solution from a single web based platform.\nFor more information please visit <a href=\"http://www.mimecast.com\">http://www.mimecast.com\n<hr width=\"100%\"></a>","problem_id":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"","assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692354},{"nice_id":554,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/02/16 12:04:39 +0000","field_358835":"","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0.1","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/02/16 12:00:39 +0000","score":0,"resolution_time":24,"priority_id":0,"current_tags":"ie8 not_billable twitter","assignee_id":3686603,"updated_at":"2010/04/18 13:15:45 +0100","req_name":"Liz Goulding","comments":[{"created_at":"2010/02/16 12:00:40 +0000","attachments":[{"size":154176,"created_at":"2010/02/16 12:00:40 +0000","content_type":"image/jpeg","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/m0l6s9pjt064g03/?name=image001.jpg","token":"m0l6s9pjt064g03","id":3408697,"filename":"image001.jpg","is_public":true}],"via_id":4,"value":"Liz Goulding\n\nNew Media Producer\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\n\nDirect line: +44 (0) 203 2012 297\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nwww.london2012.com  \n\nwww.twitter.com/london2012 \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: Morag Reavley \nSent: 16 February 2010 09:37\nTo: Liz Goulding\nSubject: Venues hub page\n\n \n\nThis looks very odd in IE8...\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMorag Reavley\nNew Media Manager\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\n23rd Floor, One Churchill Place\nLondon E14 5LN\nDirect line: +44 (0) 203 2012 160\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\nwww.london2012.com\nwww.twitter.com/london2012 \nwww.youtube.com/london2012  \n\n \n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n \nThis E-mail is confidential.

I attach a crude mock-up to show you what the changes would be but they are:\r\nWe need a video in place of the square hero image. I have asked Big Button to create a player similar to the one created for 1000 days to go; it will be 340x 355 px.\r\n \r\nDown the right hand column we would like to add in two content feature boxes (text) down the right hand side of the hub page, plus Other sites and Publications feature boxes, and remove the Upcoming events box altogether. Is it also possible to pull in Latest news and Latest blogs into this template?\r\n \r\nAlong the bottom of the page we would like to incorporate a graphic along the width of the page, similar to the pictogram graphics on the Sports content pages. Is it possible to add an editable graphic area along the bottom? I am happy to lose the scrolling feature device as this will interfere with the graphic.\r\n \r\nI would also need a modified version of the content page which could incorporate a graphic along the bottom, similar to the landing page. The content pages should have Related photos and Videos plus all the usual content boxes except Upcoming events. Is it also possible to embed videos as standard within these pages?\r\n \r\nOn the II pages I would like to just be able to pull in International Inspiration themed news and blogs. I don’t think this tag exists in the system as a main category – can we add it so that we can localise the news and blogs content on the page?\r\n \r\nIn terms of timeline, this is unfortunately short notice but high priority. I am hoping that it is possible to utilise existing modules to make these changes not too onerous. Is it possible to make these amds by the end of Weds, 7 Feb so that we can input the content ready for the launch of the Vancouver Games on Friday night?\r\n \r\nMany thanks for your help.

I attach a crude mock-up to show you what the changes would be but they are:\r\nWe need a video in place of the square hero image. I have asked Big Button to create a player similar to the one created for 1000 days to go; it will be 340x 355 px.\r\n \r\nDown the right hand column we would like to add in two content feature boxes (text) down the right hand side of the hub page, plus Other sites and Publications feature boxes, and remove the Upcoming events box altogether. Is it also possible to pull in Latest news and Latest blogs into this template?\r\n \r\nAlong the bottom of the page we would like to incorporate a graphic along the width of the page, similar to the pictogram graphics on the Sports content pages. Is it possible to add an editable graphic area along the bottom? I am happy to lose the scrolling feature device as this will interfere with the graphic.\r\n \r\nI would also need a modified version of the content page which could incorporate a graphic along the bottom, similar to the landing page. The content pages should have Related photos and Videos plus all the usual content boxes except Upcoming events. Is it also possible to embed videos as standard within these pages?\r\n \r\nOn the II pages I would like to just be able to pull in International Inspiration themed news and blogs. I don’t think this tag exists in the system as a main category – can we add it so that we can localise the news and blogs content on the page?\r\n \r\nIn terms of timeline, this is unfortunately short notice but high priority. I am hoping that it is possible to utilise existing modules to make these changes not too onerous. Is it possible to make these amds by the end of Weds, 7 Feb so that we can input the content ready for the launch of the Vancouver Games on Friday night?\r\n \r\nMany thanks for your help.
