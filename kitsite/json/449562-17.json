Once it is \"published\" (which should more accurately be known as \"queued for publication\", it then takes a minute or so for the cms to actually promote it to the live servers. There is then a synchronisation process (which Kitsite has no control over) which can then take up to 5 minutes to push the updates across all of the live servers. The upshot is that - even if scheduling was working perfectly - your page would not have appeared on the live site for up to 5 or 6 minutes (sometimes even longer, at busy times).\r\nThe next time you schedule a page for publication could you let us know before you do it please, so that someone can (virtually!) look over your shoulder to see what is going wrong.\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nKieran\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/08/17 10:54:31 +0100","via_id":19,"value":"This ticket was closed and merged into ticket #1165 \"Re: Scheduling in the CMS\".","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3663591}],"latest_recipients":"support+id1170@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"status_id":4,"field_148059":"","description":"Hi Guys \n\n \n\nI just wanted to let you know that I have scheduled the Lee Valley White\nWater Centre video to be published at 10.00. \n\n \n\nIf it doesn't work I will have to publish it manually. \n\n \n\nThanks\n\nUzma. \n\n \n\nUzma Khan\n\nCommunications Assistant  \n\nCommunications  \n\nDirect line: 020 3023 6927\n\n \n\nOlympic Delivery Authority\n\nMailpoint: 7a\n\n23rd Floor, One Churchill Place\n\nLondon E14 5LN\n\n \n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\n\nwww.london2012.com  \n\n \n\nFind out what is going on at London 2012 HQ - http://blog.london2012.com\n \n\n \n\n*\n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email\n\n \n\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">This email and any attachments are for the attention of the addressee(s) only.\nIt may also be confidential.
