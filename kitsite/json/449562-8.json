(first letter a capital\nand lower case from then on)\n\n \n\nPlease let me know what this entails on your side.\n\n \n\n \n\nRegards\n\nUzma.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUzma Khan\n\nMarketing Assistant \n\nCommunications \n\nDirect line: 020 3023 6927\n\n \n\nOlympic Delivery Authority\n\nMailpoint: 7a\n\n23rd Floor, One Churchill Place\n\nLondon E14 5LN\n\n \n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\n\nwww.london2012.com http://www.london2012.com/ \n\n \n\nFind out what is going on at London 2012 HQ - http://blog.london2012.com\nhttp://blog.london2012.com/ \n\n \n\n \n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email\n\n \n\nFrom: Danny Sofer [mailto:notifications-support@postcms.zendesk.com] \nSent: 17 February 2011 15:18\nTo: Uzma Khan\nSubject: [PostCMS support] Re: Splash page : make\nvideo/tour/photos/webcam conditional on include existing","channel":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":null,"assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":8189631},{"score":40,"nice_id":2931,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/03/01 15:20:23 +0000","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","ticket_id":35563375,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/03/07 18:26:41 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/07 18:26:41 +0000","ticket_id":35563375,"value":"0.5"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","ticket_id":35563375,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/10 11:56:43 +0000","ticket_id":35563375,"value":"billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","ticket_id":35563375,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/03/07 18:26:41 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/10 11:56:42 +0000","ticket_id":35563375,"value":"0.5"},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/03/07 18:26:41 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/07 18:26:41 +0000","ticket_id":35563375,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/07 18:26:41 +0000","ticket_id":35563375,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/07 18:26:41 +0000","ticket_id":35563375,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/07 18:26:41 +0000","ticket_id":35563375,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","ticket_id":35563375,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","updated_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:15 +0000","ticket_id":35563375,"value":"0"}],"field_97116":"0.5","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:08 +0000","comments":[{"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:10 +0000","attachments":[{"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/pnypemxejnzmpd2/?name=1.gif","size":55680,"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:10 +0000","content_type":"image/gif","token":"pnypemxejnzmpd2","id":17925323,"filename":"1.gif","is_public":true},{"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/nuxgiex83q0jtq0/?name=2.gif","size":110685,"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:12 +0000","content_type":"image/gif","token":"nuxgiex83q0jtq0","id":17925333,"filename":"2.gif","is_public":true},{"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/kqdgna8t5zvgvaj/?name=3.gif","size":65245,"created_at":"2011/03/01 14:24:14 +0000","content_type":"image/gif","token":"kqdgna8t5zvgvaj","id":17925338,"filename":"3.gif","is_public":true}],"via_id":4,"value":"Continuing Getty issues I'm afraid.

I think when you search for the image in the CMS you'll need to use the CMS display name and not the filename.\n\nJamie\n\n<image path='01-Mar-2011_12_17_52/109499319JF002_2.JPG(4)' data='01-Mar-2011_12_17_52/109499319JF002_2.JPG(4).xml'>\n<gyi:records xmlns:gyi='http://ns.gettyimages.com/mediaManager/metasheet/1.0'>\n<gyi:record>\n<gyi:filename>109499319JF002_2.JPG</gyi:filename>\n<gyi:value name='Filename'>109499319JF002_2.JPG</gyi:value>","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/03/01 18:24:59 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hi Justin.

The frontend component (i.e. the actual search box & results) would be the easiest part to implement. The bit that would involve most work on our part would be the indexing of the data - i.e. adding the my2012 pages to the search index.\r\nBasically every time a page is created/changed/expired in the my2012 site, the search index needs to be notified accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis can happen in a number of ways:\r\n\r\n1. The site can simply be periodically \"scraped\" - this is the least reliable way, and has the disadvantage that it is harder to reliably extract metadata - the search would essentially just be a free text search.\r\n\r\n2. The my2012 content repository can be told to inform the search index whenever a \r\npage is published, or removed from the website, and to tell it which content is searchable (including things like dates & metadata). This is how the www.london2012.com website works.\r\n\r\n3. If there is an API that we could use, we could periodically poll the my2012 repository to say \"give me a list of content that has changed, including dates, metadata, etc.\", and we can then update the repository accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful to have some more information regarding the approximate size of the dataset that would be being searched, and also to know exactly what the my2012 backed / cms / repository is - in particular, whether it has an api, or is programmable/customizable in any way? If you have this information, please let me know - also, please ask if you have any more questions,\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nKieran\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/03/15 16:38:05 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Thanks, Kieran!

This is obviously much more disruptive as it holds up editorial.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn terms of \"populating templates on the staging server to allow for testing\" the staging server will just sits between the CMS and the live web servers (web01-06) as part of the publication workflow. Under normal usage pages are created and published from the CMS to the staging server [as fully rendered HTML] from where they are replicated onto web01-06.\r\n\r\nThink of it as a live[-1] server\r\n\r\nAll that will happen in this case is we will reconfigure the replication process so that the pages only get as far as the staging server (until they are signed off).\r\n\r\nOne thing to be aware of though is that the staging server (described above) sits directly in the main publication workflow, although we can stop replication of pages by section/path, pages outside of those section will still be published and if they contain links to pages within a section that has been 'held back' those links will result in page not found errors. \r\n\r\nIndeed as this site has hardly any server side (ie. PHP) functionality it may be preferable to preview and test the pages directly the CMS, this has the advantage that if the pages themselves aren't yet published then any pages that link to them will automatically have the relevant links suppressed. Therefore in many way this is a safer way to preview pages / sign off the site (the pages are rendered exactly as they would be when published with the advantage that links to them won't appear in pages that are published). Indeed this is how Morag and her team would normally sign off a site like this, which doesn't have server side components (and therefore doesn't actually need to be published to a web server in order to be tested).\r\n\r\nA couple of points of clarification: \r\n\r\n- You mention \"KitSite staging server\" the staging server I am referring to above is a BT managed server (although we do have access to it).\r\n- We also have our own development and staging servers, which I know Russ has accessed in the past (esp. when we are doing more 'risky' development, that may effect other areas of the site or CMS) but I assume by the trail of e-mails that this isn't the server that is begin refereed to.\r\n\r\nI hope I haven't further added complication, but I wanted to clarify what is meant when the phrase 'staging server' is discussed as it can obviously give an impression of a 'snapshot of the site' that can be tested in complete isolation and then deployed in one click, this is not the case.\r\n\r\nIn many way for your requirements I would say previewing the pages in the CMS prior to publication is by far the safest and least troublesome way to test the site.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/03/07 12:14:25 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"I think we have decided not to redirect the existing banners.

It was a micro site that sat outside the CMS. Seehttp://www.london2012.com/olympic-route-network/home.html\n> Because it was never ‘templated’, it’s much harder to update, and it looks like we need to make a fair few changes over the next year. Can you let me know how much it would cost to ‘template’ it, so that it could be amended in the CMS?\n>  \n> The forthcoming changes would only extend to adding/changing/removing sections down the left hand nav and adding/changing body text, including links to map pdfs.\n>  \n> In the meantime I’ll get a brief together for the spectator templates that Cogapp have just sent you.\n>  \n> Many thanks\n> Simon\n>  \n>  \n> Simon Knowles\n> Marketing Manager\n> Communications\n> Direct line:  +44 (0)20 3023 6595\n> Mobile 07827 831412\n>  \n> Olympic Delivery Authority\n> Mailpoint: 7a\n> 23rd Floor, One Churchill Place\n> London E14 5LN\n>  \n> Switchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\n> Fax: +44 (0)20 3 2012 001\n> www.london2012.com\n>  \n>  \n> Find out what is going on at London 2012 HQ – http://blog.london2012.com\n>  \n> P Please consider the environment before printing this email\n>  \n> \n> \n> \n> This email and any attachments are for the attention of the addressee(s) only.
