I have uploaded the files direct to the webserver as a workaround, which for the short term should work fine, but it does mean that we have files that aren't in the CMS so if we republish to the Staging server (for example) these files may not get published.\r\n\r\n    Solution: You may want to get McCann to resupply a SWF file which references lowercase mp3 files with dashes instead of underscores ie. accreditation-and-uniform-collection.mp3\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nWe are yet to fully test cross browser, but if you can let me know if if the page above is what you are after we'll get onto that.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/01/12 17:18:29 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Hi Morag,\r\n\r\n** Please read previous comment (above) first (which is the main response) **\r\n\r\nBut I just remembered we also need a fall back image or even just a text version for non Flash users (*) \r\n\r\n- We could just create a big text area that is replaced with the SWF when the page is loaded if Flash is supported (else the user just gets the rich text area)\r\n- We could just got for an image (if you can fit all the info on it)\r\n- We could just got for an image + image map (so that each item on the image opens a new page)\r\n- We could just got for an image + image map + some javascript  (so that each item on the image opens a popup - further question over whether this is styled and also what we do if the user doesn't have JS).\r\n\r\nIf you go for an  image it needs to be 718px wide (see my comment about Flash size above).\r\n\r\nThe text fall back is starting to look the easiest :)\r\n\r\n* The non-flash user base now includes iPhone/iPad (which don't have and can't install Flash).

We now finally have the assets for the updated International Inspiration pages - www.london2012.com/internationalinspiration \r\n\r\n1. New splash page - there will be a new splash page in the manner of the splash page we used for Volunteering. McCann have produced a swf file which should be dropped into an 'empty' template which only has the top and bottom navigation on it. See the assets in Splash Page.zip attached.\r\n\r\n2. New Int Insp hub page template (the page after the splash page) - McCann have designed a new template (design attached as Hub page design.jpg) which is pretty similar to existing templates except that it has an editable media pod at the top, similar to media pod on the Volunteering pages. The other new element is the new banner at the top of the page, for which assets are also available.\r\n\r\n3. New Int Ins content pages - these will remain basically as they are but we want all the pages to have an International Inspiration banner with the keyline running across them, as per the Sports pages (which means also removing the current keyline at the bottom of the pages). The colour of these banners will alternate between the four London 2012 brand colours. There is also a new blue angular feature box in the right hand column (as per the hub page design). I will provide psd files for these four coloured banners shortly but in terms of size they will be coloured variants on the banner in the Hub page design.\r\n\r\nHappy to chat through these when you have had a look at the assets. Time-wise, I would love this to be available for launch at the end of January - is that possible?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\nMorag","type":"Comment","attachments":[{"size":1213784,"created_at":"2011/01/10 19:48:36 +0000","content_type":"image/pjpeg","token":"zsnkv3axj0g53ma","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/zsnkv3axj0g53ma/?name=Hub_page_design.jpg","id":14829579,"filename":"Hub_page_design.jpg","is_public":true},{"size":670175,"created_at":"2011/01/10 19:49:55 +0000","content_type":"application/x-zip-compressed","token":"7gtub09wsee3zls","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/7gtub09wsee3zls/?name=Splash_Page.zip","id":14829673,"filename":"Splash_Page.zip","is_public":true}],"is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2011/01/10 19:54:33 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"NB Re: the splash page, I should stress that this needs to be embedded into an International Inspiration (Get Involved) template, not a Games Maker template.\n\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2011/01/10 20:04:00 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Please find attached the media pod assets for the new hub page template, mentioned above.

We now finally have the assets for the updated International Inspiration pages - www.london2012.com/internationalinspiration \r\n\r\n1. New splash page - there will be a new splash page in the manner of the splash page we used for Volunteering. McCann have produced a swf file which should be dropped into an 'empty' template which only has the top and bottom navigation on it. See the assets in Splash Page.zip attached.\r\n\r\n2. New Int Insp hub page template (the page after the splash page) - McCann have designed a new template (design attached as Hub page design.jpg) which is pretty similar to existing templates except that it has an editable media pod at the top, similar to media pod on the Volunteering pages. The other new element is the new banner at the top of the page, for which assets are also available.\r\n\r\n3. New Int Ins content pages - these will remain basically as they are but we want all the pages to have an International Inspiration banner with the keyline running across them, as per the Sports pages (which means also removing the current keyline at the bottom of the pages). The colour of these banners will alternate between the four London 2012 brand colours. There is also a new blue angular feature box in the right hand column (as per the hub page design). I will provide psd files for these four coloured banners shortly but in terms of size they will be coloured variants on the banner in the Hub page design.\r\n\r\nHappy to chat through these when you have had a look at the assets. Time-wise, I would love this to be available for launch at the end of January - is that possible?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\nMorag","organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"1.8","assignee_name":"Lars Bortfeldt","problem_id":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692462},{"channel":null,"nice_id":2571,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:31 +0000","field_358835":"0.1","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0.1","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/01/26 09:09:33 +0000","resolution_time":3,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"capped level_1 none_required tested","assignee_id":3690996,"updated_at":"2011/01/27 11:31:18 +0000","req_name":"Liz Goulding","linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:31 +0000","solved_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:31 +0000","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"capped","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:31 +0000","score":30,"via_id":4,"subject":"RE: Rio 2016 logo","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","group_id":61946,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","ticket_id":31279375,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/01/26 12:02:33 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/26 12:08:59 +0000","ticket_id":31279375,"value":"0.1"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","ticket_id":31279375,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/27 11:31:18 +0000","ticket_id":31279375,"value":"capped"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","ticket_id":31279375,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/01/26 12:02:33 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/26 12:02:33 +0000","ticket_id":31279375,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/01/26 12:02:34 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","ticket_id":31279375,"value":"0.1"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","ticket_id":31279375,"value":"level_1"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","ticket_id":31279375,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","ticket_id":31279375,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:30 +0000","ticket_id":31279375,"value":"0"}],"submitter_id":3709935,"base_score":30,"comments":[{"created_at":"2011/01/26 09:09:33 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"I actually think this is one that Kitsite need to do -\n\nSupport person, can you please take a look?

The issue lies in the fact that we have 6 live servers with no central/single database (ie. a simple public facing mysql database) in which to track clicks.\n\nIdeally we'd just have one server (even if that was just web06) that was addressed as banners.london2012.com that served up / tracked all banners, that way we could have a single DB of all users and then each time a banner was clicked we updated a row in the database.\n\nIn normal circumstances I would simply suggest that we ask BT to setup a new server/instance (banners.london2012.com) and we'd be home and dry; but realise the issues around this / the unlikeliness of this happening. Another approach would be to rent some cloud hosting off a 3rd party (ie. MediaTemple) to just handle the banner serving/tracking, this would solve the issue and be low cost ~$50/month would probably get you all the bandwidth/capacity you needed). But I can understand why ITS may be uneasy about that. Although we do actually already do this (ie. use some cloud hosting from MediaTemple) to handle images arriving from Getty via FTP, this was discussed with Morag/ODA although ITS may not be aware of it; it is also more a backend process/server between Getty and the CMS.\n</snipdepends on reporting requirements>\n\nIf we don't have a central DB we could still store signups but we won't be able to track clicks on each banner with the same level of granularity and/or create a dedicated reporting interface.\n\nWe could track most of the data in Google Analytics by serving the banner in an IFRAME the only thing to be aware of if we took that approach is that the data may not be as readily available on a single page.\n\nSo...to recap ;-)\n\nIf you happy with us tracking the data in Google Analytics (ie. no single reporting page) then the times at the top still stand.\n\nIf you want a single ie. a single reporting page / db then the times/costs aren't widely different, but we would need a server with a mysql DB (or be able to provision on ourselves from say MediaTemple)\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/12/03 16:55:35 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Hey Jamie,\n\nSo, I think what we would like is to keep it Google analytics based, but to create a ‘campaign’ called ‘link to us’ ... so that the link embedded on the images contains a GA tag (i don’t think we need an iFrame for this?) that we can then track it’s click-usage. I believe that would work? I’ve attached the report we are getting at the moment (we don’t currently have any tracking after download at all), so as long as we can continue to collect all the attached data and have a basic understanding of how much traffic is coming through to us from the banners in general, we should be ok.\n\nI think having it be more interactive (choose theme, then size) would be a nice idea. Let me see what the brand team is actually going to produce for us ... it might just be generic. Can you get started without that info.\n\nDoes that work?

I have therefore only estimated for development / testing on our dev CMS and a single deployment to the live CMS once we're happy with it, with a bit of post launch testing.\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[{"size":506639,"created_at":"2011/01/12 12:31:12 +0000","content_type":"image/png","token":"lqpaej0zhmfdlci","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/lqpaej0zhmfdlci/?name=linkToUsLondon-2012.png","id":14939140,"filename":"linkToUsLondon-2012.png","is_public":true}],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/01/12 18:44:38 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Reminder: Liz also wants to make sure that the existing banners do not fail, so we probably need to move them onto the london2012 servers and request for the DNS for london-2012.co.uk to be repointed there.

In particular the most common phones used by Samsung staff, whatever that is? We therefore thought it wise not to auto-redirect sites using the Android browser until that testing had been done, in case it upset your Mobile sponsor, once you're happy we can auto-redirect to it.\n\nJust to clarify:\n\nThe iPhone is a combined device+OS+software ie. it only has one browser (Safari) and most importantly one screen size (iphone size) so we know it displays correctly on *every* iPhone out there.\n\nAndroid is an Operating System (like Windows or Linux) it's *not* a device and it therefore doesn't specify a screen size, in fact Android doesn't even guarantee you'll be using a given web browser, although most likely you'll be using the default one, which (as luck would have it) is exactly the same rendering engine as Safari on an iPhone. What this means is that any phone running Android with a screen size similar to the iPhone will render the site exactly as it is rendered on an iPhone.\n\nThe issue is not Android vs iPhone OS (ie. the Operating System of the phone) it's that if someone is running Android on a device with the screen size of a postage stamp the site might not display /exactly/ as intended. Maybe it would be more correct to say \"The mobile site will work on any device running Android with a screen size similar to the iPhone\" (which I expect is 95%+ of the Android market).\n\nIn short the site will render perfectly on any Android device with decent sized rectangular screen.\n\nDo let me know if you need *any* clarification here, as I think we probably need to quickly reel in any confusion that may have been caused.\n\nJamie\n\n(*) 'Android friendly' really only makes sense in terms of Apps and /not/ websites, because an application (as opposed to a website) is dependent on the OS the phone is running. So while you can say \"My app (only) runs on Android and/or iPhone\" the same doesn't really apply to a website. My guess is there may have been a small amount of confusion here.","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/11/16 12:11:43 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Aha!
