I.e. could we provide the app as a java applet, silverlight, flash etc?\r\n\r\nThe London 2012 web guidelines I think exclude Java applets and Silverlight.\r\n\r\nFlash is fine as long as we degrade gracefully, which in this case would mean a user would just see the webcam as an image.\r\n\r\n\t• If we hosted the app on our servers and you presented it in an <iframe> on your page, would that be ok?\r\n\r\nIf this was /just to provide the overlay/ I think this would be acceptable.\r\n\r\nBut it wouldn't be acceptable for the underlying static webcam image, firstly I think ODA/LOCOG would like all images to be served from their domain so that they get indexed in Google Image search with the correct domain, secondly from a usability perspective we try to avoid IFRAMES for any key content and finally lastly we need a copy of the latest image in the CMS / tied to a webcam page so we can pull a thumbnail of it into other pages such as the Venue pages based on related tags.\r\n\r\n I think that is all I can think of for now. Any details on how the current system works would help.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the functionality and how the Flash movie is loaded into the page as an overlay, have a look at this page.\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/webcams/velodrome.php\r\n\r\nIn terms of the images themselves we just retrieve a copy of the webcam from yourselves every 15 mins, hold it for 15mins (in case of a accident etc.) and then publish it out to the live site (sample url below). We don't keep an historical copies of the images on the live server.\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/transform/1965113/m700x/velodrome.jpg\r\n\r\nHopefully that answers a few questions, let us know if you need any more info..\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603}],"latest_recipients":null,"due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"status_id":4,"field_148059":"","description":"Hi Jamie\r\n \r\nAs you know, you carried out some work allowing us to turn on/off time-lapse function on the webcams, which is great feature for us to be able to use.\r\n \r\nHowever we would like to find a permanent solution allowing us to sort out issues with the current time-lapse on the webcams. which possibly  means we stop using Stamen to produce the time-lapse for the webcams  and start using Site-Eye as they hold all the images and there would be one less supplier in the chain.

I can ask BT to check with regards to the testing, however, their testing team is currently busy on another project, and the adistars project will be their next port of call. Can KitSite be asked how they are pulling the products into our site (I can do this if you prefer) – depending on what solution they are implementing we may be able to get away with this without BT having to do long strenuous testing...”\n\nCan you provide an answer to Jag’s question above re: how the products are being pulled in?

I'm happy to pay as long as we can get the work done very soon.\n\nRE: pushing integration live, I am still waiting to hear from eCommera that they are satisfied with the feed. They have acknowledged that we have the right feed, but that they are not sending all the right information through. We can't publish until they have sorted this out.
