(in which case the <h1> might not look so odd).\r\n\r\nI also have a couple of other small issues that may need to go back to McCann\r\n\r\n  - The Flash file as supplied was too wide @ 727x866 to fit, it needs to be 718px wide (for now I have scaled both height and width so it fits). \r\n\r\n     Solution: You may want to get McCann to resupply a 718px SWF file so it fits perfectly.\r\n\r\n - The /sound sub folder has files with CamelCaps case and underscore, we flatten these when they get imported into the CMS so that \"Accreditation_and_Uniform_Collection.mp3\" becomes \"accreditation-and-uniform-collection.mp3\". I have uploaded the files direct to the webserver as a workaround, which for the short term should work fine, but it does mean that we have files that aren't in the CMS so if we republish to the Staging server (for example) these files may not get published.\r\n\r\n    Solution: You may want to get McCann to resupply a SWF file which references lowercase mp3 files with dashes instead of underscores ie. accreditation-and-uniform-collection.mp3\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nWe are yet to fully test cross browser, but if you can let me know if if the page above is what you are after we'll get onto that.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/01/12 17:18:29 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi Morag,\r\n\r\n** Please read previous comment (above) first (which is the main response) **\r\n\r\nBut I just remembered we also need a fall back image or even just a text version for non Flash users (*) \r\n\r\n- We could just create a big text area that is replaced with the SWF when the page is loaded if Flash is supported (else the user just gets the rich text area)\r\n- We could just got for an image (if you can fit all the info on it)\r\n- We could just got for an image + image map (so that each item on the image opens a new page)\r\n- We could just got for an image + image map + some javascript  (so that each item on the image opens a popup - further question over whether this is styled and also what we do if the user doesn't have JS).\r\n\r\nIf you go for an  image it needs to be 718px wide (see my comment about Flash size above).\r\n\r\nThe text fall back is starting to look the easiest :)\r\n\r\n* The non-flash user base now includes iPhone/iPad (which don't have and can't install Flash).

We now finally have the assets for the updated International Inspiration pages - www.london2012.com/internationalinspiration \r\n\r\n1. New splash page - there will be a new splash page in the manner of the splash page we used for Volunteering. McCann have produced a swf file which should be dropped into an 'empty' template which only has the top and bottom navigation on it. See the assets in Splash Page.zip attached.\r\n\r\n2. New Int Insp hub page template (the page after the splash page) - McCann have designed a new template (design attached as Hub page design.jpg) which is pretty similar to existing templates except that it has an editable media pod at the top, similar to media pod on the Volunteering pages. The other new element is the new banner at the top of the page, for which assets are also available.\r\n\r\n3. New Int Ins content pages - these will remain basically as they are but we want all the pages to have an International Inspiration banner with the keyline running across them, as per the Sports pages (which means also removing the current keyline at the bottom of the pages). The colour of these banners will alternate between the four London 2012 brand colours. There is also a new blue angular feature box in the right hand column (as per the hub page design). I will provide psd files for these four coloured banners shortly but in terms of size they will be coloured variants on the banner in the Hub page design.\r\n\r\nHappy to chat through these when you have had a look at the assets.

We now finally have the assets for the updated International Inspiration pages - www.london2012.com/internationalinspiration \r\n\r\n1. New splash page - there will be a new splash page in the manner of the splash page we used for Volunteering. McCann have produced a swf file which should be dropped into an 'empty' template which only has the top and bottom navigation on it. See the assets in Splash Page.zip attached.\r\n\r\n2. New Int Insp hub page template (the page after the splash page) - McCann have designed a new template (design attached as Hub page design.jpg) which is pretty similar to existing templates except that it has an editable media pod at the top, similar to media pod on the Volunteering pages. The other new element is the new banner at the top of the page, for which assets are also available.\r\n\r\n3. New Int Ins content pages - these will remain basically as they are but we want all the pages to have an International Inspiration banner with the keyline running across them, as per the Sports pages (which means also removing the current keyline at the bottom of the pages). The colour of these banners will alternate between the four London 2012 brand colours. There is also a new blue angular feature box in the right hand column (as per the hub page design). I will provide psd files for these four coloured banners shortly but in terms of size they will be coloured variants on the banner in the Hub page design.\r\n\r\nHappy to chat through these when you have had a look at the assets. Time-wise, I would love this to be available for launch at the end of January - is that possible?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\nMorag","problem_id":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"1.8","assignee_name":"Lars Bortfeldt","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692462},{"nice_id":2571,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/01/26 12:09:31 +0000","field_358835":"0.1","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0.1","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/01/26 09:09:33 +0000","score":0,"resolution_time":3,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"capped level_1 none_required tested","assignee_id":3690996,"updated_at":"2011/04/26 13:30:38 +0100","req_name":"Liz Goulding","comments":[{"created_at":"2011/01/26 09:09:33 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"I actually think this is one that Kitsite need to do -\n\nSupport person, can you please take a look?
