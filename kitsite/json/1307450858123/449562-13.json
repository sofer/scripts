The ones that just contain scrolling text headlines and nearly always say ‘BREAKING NEWS’ on them?  We have one of those on the London 2012 live site big screens around the UK, and we’ve just been given permission by the BBC to put whatever information we want on them when the live sites are broadcasting London 2012 specific material (which is about 20 minutes every hour).\r\n \r\nThe ticker works by pulling in an RSS feed, and we were going to try and use our latest few news headlines and straplines. But after a few discussions our Comms team in general have decided that they’d like us to set up something a bit more complicated and we were wondering if you guys would be able to build this for us.\r\n \r\nWhat we’re looking for is (we imagine) a form with entry fields which we can populate which will generate RSS that the live sites can pull in to populate to ticker.  We were imagining that from our end it would be as simple as a form with, for example, 10 text-only entry boxes. The form would recognise when fields were and weren’t populated and play the populated fields one by one in order, on a loop.\r\n \r\nSo, an example of what we might populate the fields with:\r\n \r\nField 1: 20th August 2010 – London 2012 has announced that pole dancing will now be the only Olympic sport\r\nField 2:\r\nField 3:\r\nField 4:\r\nField 5: 20th August 2010 – Usain Bolt bored of winning everything\r\nField 6:\r\nField 7:\r\nField 8:\r\nField 9: For all the latest news updates on London 2012 visit www.london2012.com, www.facebook.com/london2012, www.twitter.com/london2012\r\nField 10:\r\n \r\nIn this example, whenever we updated the form (and clicked a ‘submit’ button, or something?) it would recognise that certain fields were empty, and the RSS the form generated would populate the ticker with the populated fields consecutively. So it would loop 1, 5, and 9, ignoring the rest. We’re thinking we’d update it a lot with all sorts of info to keep things very topical.\r\n \r\nDoes this sound like something you guys could do?\r\n \r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/08/25 15:16:51 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"How’s the spec / costing coming for this Jamie?\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3734551},{"created_at":"2010/08/25 18:47:40 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi Finn,\r\n\r\nAre you OK with this coming off the retainer, if so I'd expect we'd spend 2 days writing, getting this setup.\r\n\r\nWhat you've written below is fine it terms of a spec for us to work from, so if your OK with us progressing on this with an pretty firm estimate of 2 days then more than happy to progress, we'll prototype something a bit first and we can tweak a bit as we go along and once it's in place within those two days \r\n\r\nIs there any particular RSS format they need (as I said we can tweak this once started, it won't change costs, but would be good to know if there is a preferred version).\r\n\r\nShall we get started?\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/08/26 19:37:52 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"That’s grand Jamie, yep.\n\nAmy who does our video has sent a request to the beeb about what type of RSS they require, have cc:d her here as i’m off until Weds now.\n\nAmy, if you hear from the BBC about this before I get back could you let Jamie know if you get a sec please?\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3734551},{"created_at":"2010/09/06 11:59:28 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"I'm about to start with this - any news from BBC by any chance?","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":4323506},{"created_at":"2010/09/07 11:13:31 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Finn,\r\n\r\nTo speed up the process a bit, can you please confirm that the display people can work with this rss:\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/test/bigscreenrss.xml\r\n\r\nTo edit the contents, go to http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/folder/test and edit the bigscreen (not bigscreenrss) page in the page editor.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":4323506},{"created_at":"2010/09/10 12:16:03 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hey Janos.

Would you have any idea how that would effect the feed running on the screen? E.g. might it jerk back to the beginning of the looped text? I don’t know if that’s something the BBC’s set up would dictate or not\n\n2) Should we want to expand on what’s been built so far, how difficult would the following be for you guys?:\n\n\na) Add the ability to set a start and end date on fields so that they are added and removed from the feed after running for a certain period.\n\nFor example, between April 1st and 3rd:\n\nField one says “Hello” and has no date settings\nField two says “Everybody” and is set to start at the beginning of April 1st and finish at the end of April 2nd\nField three says “How are you” and has a start date of the start of April 2nd and no end date\n\nApril 1st feed reads “Hello Everybody”\nApril 2nd feed reads “Hello Everybody How are you”\nApril 3rd onwards feed reads “Hello How are you”\n\n\nb) Add some titles to the fields so that we can assign them to different teams here (I presume that’s pretty easy)\n\n\n3) I assume there’s no character count on the fields?

The ones that just contain scrolling text headlines and nearly always say ‘BREAKING NEWS’ on them?  We have one of those on the London 2012 live site big screens around the UK, and we’ve just been given permission by the BBC to put whatever information we want on them when the live sites are broadcasting London 2012 specific material (which is about 20 minutes every hour).\r\n \r\nThe ticker works by pulling in an RSS feed, and we were going to try and use our latest few news headlines and straplines. But after a few discussions our Comms team in general have decided that they’d like us to set up something a bit more complicated and we were wondering if you guys would be able to build this for us.\r\n \r\nWhat we’re looking for is (we imagine) a form with entry fields which we can populate which will generate RSS that the live sites can pull in to populate to ticker.  We were imagining that from our end it would be as simple as a form with, for example, 10 text-only entry boxes. The form would recognise when fields were and weren’t populated and play the populated fields one by one in order, on a loop.\r\n \r\nSo, an example of what we might populate the fields with:\r\n \r\nField 1: 20th August 2010 – London 2012 has announced that pole dancing will now be the only Olympic sport\r\nField 2:\r\nField 3:\r\nField 4:\r\nField 5: 20th August 2010 – Usain Bolt bored of winning everything\r\nField 6:\r\nField 7:\r\nField 8:\r\nField 9: For all the latest news updates on London 2012 visit www.london2012.com, www.facebook.com/london2012, www.twitter.com/london2012\r\nField 10:\r\n \r\nIn this example, whenever we updated the form (and clicked a ‘submit’ button, or something?) it would recognise that certain fields were empty, and the RSS the form generated would populate the ticker with the populated fields consecutively. So it would loop 1, 5, and 9, ignoring the rest. We’re thinking we’d update it a lot with all sorts of info to keep things very topical.\r\n \r\nDoes this sound like something you guys could do?\r\n \r\n","problem_id":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"3","assignee_name":"Janos P Toth","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3734551},{"nice_id":1467,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/09/22 17:08:24 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"20","field_97116":"0","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/09/22 15:53:27 +0100","score":0,"resolution_time":2036,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"20 authorized level_0 none_required","assignee_id":3686603,"updated_at":"2011/03/16 11:30:43 +0000","req_name":"Morag Reavley","comments":[{"created_at":"2010/09/22 15:53:27 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hello\r\n\r\nWe have a small piece of work upcoming on the International Inspiration section of our website:\r\n\r\n* New landing page to update www.london2012.com/internationalinspiration\r\nThis will be a new page but will be similar to http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/volunteer/index.php The main new thing is that we want to have a deep banner similar to the Sport pages, plus a larger media pod like the Games Maker one which plays through photos/video.
