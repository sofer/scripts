As far as I am aware this is not a recurring issue and if images are sent in the way Justin seems to be sending them then there shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIf there is a wider issue, then we need to trace though the images from Getty (checking how they are sent; as I said I don't know the correct way; I just know one way previously caused the XML to be sent without the JPG) though the FTP server and into the CMS.

I think when you search for the image in the CMS you'll need to use the CMS display name and not the filename.\n\nJamie\n\n<image path='01-Mar-2011_12_17_52/109499319JF002_2.JPG(4)' data='01-Mar-2011_12_17_52/109499319JF002_2.JPG(4).xml'>\n<gyi:records xmlns:gyi='http://ns.gettyimages.com/mediaManager/metasheet/1.0'>\n<gyi:record>\n<gyi:filename>109499319JF002_2.JPG</gyi:filename>\n<gyi:value name='Filename'>109499319JF002_2.JPG</gyi:value>","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/03/01 18:24:59 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hi Justin.

Is this enough info from Justin for you to look into this example?\n\nFrom: Justin Setterfield\nSent: 01 March 2011 14:14\nTo: Finn Concannon\nSubject: CMS\n\nHi Finn,\n\nI have sent an image through to latest photos this morning (please see attachment 1) where you can see I have added the created date + CMS caption etc.  In attachment 2 you can see the image has been sent and is waiting to go live (Sent through around 11.30).  In attachment 3 you can see the search engine in CMS is returning 0 results for the image and its is not going to the web.  Can you try to get some feedback regarding this as it is becoming a consistent problem.\n\nThanks,\nJustin Setterfield\nFilm and Photography Coordinator\nEditorial Services\nDirect line:  +44 (0)20 3 2012 407\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nOne Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\nlondon2012.comhttp://www.london2012.com/","problem_id":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"0.5","assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3734551},{"nice_id":2958,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/03/04 11:04:38 +0000","field_358835":"0.1","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0.1","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/03/03 09:04:04 +0000","score":15,"resolution_time":105,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"authorized billable level_1 none_required tested","assignee_id":3686603,"updated_at":"2011/05/19 10:17:30 +0100","req_name":"Morag Reavley","comments":[{"created_at":"2011/03/03 09:04:04 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Please can we change the link to the shop from the Shop tab in the principal navigation?

The frontend component (i.e. the actual search box & results) would be the easiest part to implement. The bit that would involve most work on our part would be the indexing of the data - i.e. adding the my2012 pages to the search index.\r\nBasically every time a page is created/changed/expired in the my2012 site, the search index needs to be notified accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis can happen in a number of ways:\r\n\r\n1. The site can simply be periodically \"scraped\" - this is the least reliable way, and has the disadvantage that it is harder to reliably extract metadata - the search would essentially just be a free text search.\r\n\r\n2. The my2012 content repository can be told to inform the search index whenever a \r\npage is published, or removed from the website, and to tell it which content is searchable (including things like dates & metadata). This is how the www.london2012.com website works.\r\n\r\n3. If there is an API that we could use, we could periodically poll the my2012 repository to say \"give me a list of content that has changed, including dates, metadata, etc.\", and we can then update the repository accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful to have some more information regarding the approximate size of the dataset that would be being searched, and also to know exactly what the my2012 backed / cms / repository is - in particular, whether it has an api, or is programmable/customizable in any way?

Can I ask some questions to clarify this request please?\r\n\r\nI think that what you want is the following:\r\n\r\n * For Kitsite to store historical data, recording the daily totals for:\r\n     > Number of users.\r\n     > Number of users subscribed to each mailing list.\r\n     > For both of the above, we should probably store the total number, and the number of \"Live\" users (i.e. those who have clicked on their confirmation email)\r\n     \r\n * Once we have the above, we can then generate reports for specific periods. For example, to generate a weekly report, we would compare today's values with the values from seven days ago.\r\n \r\nI propose that you let us know what period you would like reports generated for, and we then run these on a schedule. For example you might tell me that you want: \r\n * A weekly report that shows weekly totals for the last 6 months.\r\n * A daily report that shows daily totals for the 7 days.\r\n \r\nAn interface via which you can generate your own reports for bespoke periods, on an ad hoc basis would be more complicated, and thus take longer.\r\n\r\nI would estimate that the simpler solution (i.e. running certain reports on a schedule) would take three days to implement.\r\n\r\nThe more complicated solution (i.e. an interface for you to generate reports on an ad hoc basis) would take longer. I can't say exactly without speaking to Janos (who is out of the office this week). I would estimate 5-6 days, but it /could/ be longer.

This is obviously much more disruptive as it holds up editorial.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn terms of \"populating templates on the staging server to allow for testing\" the staging server will just sits between the CMS and the live web servers (web01-06) as part of the publication workflow. Under normal usage pages are created and published from the CMS to the staging server [as fully rendered HTML] from where they are replicated onto web01-06.\r\n\r\nThink of it as a live[-1] server\r\n\r\nAll that will happen in this case is we will reconfigure the replication process so that the pages only get as far as the staging server (until they are signed off).\r\n\r\nOne thing to be aware of though is that the staging server (described above) sits directly in the main publication workflow, although we can stop replication of pages by section/path, pages outside of those section will still be published and if they contain links to pages within a section that has been 'held back' those links will result in page not found errors. \r\n\r\nIndeed as this site has hardly any server side (ie. PHP) functionality it may be preferable to preview and test the pages directly the CMS, this has the advantage that if the pages themselves aren't yet published then any pages that link to them will automatically have the relevant links suppressed. Therefore in many way this is a safer way to preview pages / sign off the site (the pages are rendered exactly as they would be when published with the advantage that links to them won't appear in pages that are published). Indeed this is how Morag and her team would normally sign off a site like this, which doesn't have server side components (and therefore doesn't actually need to be published to a web server in order to be tested).\r\n\r\nA couple of points of clarification: \r\n\r\n- You mention \"KitSite staging server\" the staging server I am referring to above is a BT managed server (although we do have access to it).\r\n- We also have our own development and staging servers, which I know Russ has accessed in the past (esp. when we are doing more 'risky' development, that may effect other areas of the site or CMS) but I assume by the trail of e-mails that this isn't the server that is begin refereed to.\r\n\r\nI hope I haven't further added complication, but I wanted to clarify what is meant when the phrase 'staging server' is discussed as it can obviously give an impression of a 'snapshot of the site' that can be tested in complete isolation and then deployed in one click, this is not the case.\r\n\r\nIn many way for your requirements I would say previewing the pages in the CMS prior to publication is by far the safest and least troublesome way to test the site.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/03/07 12:14:25 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"I think we have decided not to redirect the existing banners.
