In summary we're not using the event start date in the \nmap/timeline unless there's a corresponding end date. It all comes \nthrough in the API correctly it's just that the swf is falling back to \ncreation date in the absence of a full range.\n\nA quick fix on your end would be to require an end date for all events \nbefore sending them over to our API. But I'm talking to Shawn about \nimplementing a fix to the swf as well or instead. We'll keep you posted.\n\nCheers,\n\nTom.\n\n\nKieran Topping wrote:\n> Hi Tom, Mike,\n> I'm just forwarding this original email to you two, in case you \n> haven't seen it.

In summary we're not using the event start date in the \nmap/timeline unless there's a corresponding end date. It all comes \nthrough in the API correctly it's just that the swf is falling back to \ncreation date in the absence of a full range.\n\nA quick fix on your end would be to require an end date for all events \nbefore sending them over to our API. But I'm talking to Shawn about \nimplementing a fix to the swf as well or instead. We'll keep you posted.\n\nCheers,\n\nTom.\n\n\nKieran Topping wrote:\n> Hi Tom, Mike,\n> I'm just forwarding this original email to you two, in case you \n> haven't seen it.

So we can't add an \"if\" on the Event page saying \"if image is approved show it\" as publishing the event will have forced the image to be approved/published. We possibly could create a custom workflow for OW images but all of the workflow in the current Default workflow would need to be duplicated. This is what we probably need to do but worried about the knock on effect here, is it better to leave it as it is for the time being [and look again next time we do something like this] seeing as most event have already been uploaded.\r\n\r\n* I think the above was the original plan but the issue of the image being published when the page was published it was taken out.\r\n\r\n2) Ignoring the above, as it makes this point kind of irrelevant, we can't store a reference on the Image back to the Event on the image as:\r\n\r\n      a) we create the Event page after the Image, although I suppose we could try and create a unique key which is stored in the image name/filename and a meta-data field on the Event \r\n      b) we can't set any meta-data on the image other than tags (which show up on the front end), although we could possibly do this via the filename (I think we can set the filename independently of the image name)\r\n\r\n3) There are no references on any of the current images or events, so whatever we did now would only be of use for newly uploaded events. We'd also have a clean up job to do as some pages would have a user assigned / image container and new pages a image meta data field and some display code. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf we we're to go down the route (in future);\r\n\r\n1) Create image and set the filename to ow-#eventname#-#uniquenumber#.jpg [assuming this is possible? it may not be possibel to set the filename separately form the image]\r\n\r\n2a) Save this is a new /uploads/ow folder (so we can separate them out form the normal user uploads) / create a new tab in the CMS\r\n2b) Alternatively add a 'origin' to the upload servlet and filtering to the approval screen.\r\n\r\n3) Store the path to this image on the Event in a metadata 'string' field (not an image container or else it will be published)\r\n\r\n4) On the Event page check for the existence of a image field, check if an image with that name exists in a given section and then if has been approved display it. In edit mode we may want to indicate that their is an image that needs approval.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI know what Liz would really like is a screen where an image could be assign internally or externally, with a little 'approve/reject' tick-box under it for any external images, but can't see that happening as the development costs outweigh the use.\r\n\r\nSorry long email/response, with no clear conclusion..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3686603}],"linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2010/10/07 12:15:41 +0100","solved_at":"2010/07/09 12:11:10 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/07/07 16:19:45 +0100","channel":null,"via_id":4,"subject":"publishing an uploaded photos image","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","group_id":61946,"submitter_id":3709935,"base_score":0,"latest_recipients":"support+id1055@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":"Jamie Unwin","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/07/02 11:06:00 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/02 11:06:00 +0100","ticket_id":14468589,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/07/02 11:11:29 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/08 16:31:09 +0100","ticket_id":14468589,"value":"0.6"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/07/02 11:06:00 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/02 11:06:00 +0100","ticket_id":14468589,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/07/02 11:06:00 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/09 14:39:18 +0100","ticket_id":14468589,"value":"billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/07/02 11:06:00 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/09 14:39:18 +0100","ticket_id":14468589,"value":"awaiting_authorization"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/07/02 11:11:29 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/09 14:39:18 +0100","ticket_id":14468589,"value":"0.6"}],"status_id":4,"field_148059":"awaiting_authorization","description":"Bug.
