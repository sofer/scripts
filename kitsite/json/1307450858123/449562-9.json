It was a micro site that sat outside the CMS. Seehttp://www.london2012.com/olympic-route-network/home.html\n> Because it was never â€˜templatedâ€™, itâ€™s much harder to update, and it looks like we need to make a fair few changes over the next year. Can you let me know how much it would cost to â€˜templateâ€™ it, so that it could be amended in the CMS?\n>  \n> The forthcoming changes would only extend to adding/changing/removing sections down the left hand nav and adding/changing body text, including links to map pdfs.\n>  \n> In the meantime Iâ€™ll get a brief together for the spectator templates that Cogapp have just sent you.\n>  \n> Many thanks\n> Simon\n>  \n>  \n> Simon Knowles\n> Marketing Manager\n> Communications\n> Direct line:  +44 (0)20 3023 6595\n> Mobile 07827 831412\n>  \n> Olympic Delivery Authority\n> Mailpoint: 7a\n> 23rd Floor, One Churchill Place\n> London E14 5LN\n>  \n> Switchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\n> Fax: +44 (0)20 3 2012 001\n> www.london2012.com\n>  \n>  \n> Find out what is going on at London 2012 HQ â€“ http://blog.london2012.com\n>  \n> P Please consider the environment before printing this email\n>  \n> \n> \n> \n> This email and any attachments are for the attention of the addressee(s) only.
