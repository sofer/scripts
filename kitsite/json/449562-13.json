How long would it take to assign London boroughs based on postcode data against all of our London records? This need not be a permanent fix (although in the longer term it would be nice to have this information) - I am looking for being able to pull out all the records we have in the five Olympic host boroughs (Hackney, Newham, Tower Hamlets, Walthamstow, Greenwich) by Wednesday next week. \r\n\r\nOr am I wishing for the stars as usual? :-)","organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"3","assignee_name":"Janos P Toth","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692462},{"problem_id":null,"nice_id":1805,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/10/18 11:27:17 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","channel":null,"field_97116":"less than 30mins","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","resolution_time":53,"priority_id":4,"current_tags":"authorized capped","assignee_id":3663591,"updated_at":"2011/01/18 16:17:43 +0000","req_name":"Morag Reavley","ticket_type_id":4,"status_updated_at":"2011/01/18 16:17:43 +0000","solved_at":"2010/10/20 16:36:47 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"capped","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/10/18 11:27:17 +0100","linkings":[],"score":0,"via_id":0,"subject":"Please remove Tickets splash page this morning","recipient":null,"group_id":61946,"submitter_id":3692462,"base_score":0,"comments":[{"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"At your convenience!","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:32:01 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Done.","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:33:05 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Timewise: took 5mins.\r\nCovered by 1 day attached to this ticket:\r\n  http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/1633","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/18 14:10:56 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Thanks!\n\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3692462}],"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:27:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:32:01 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":"less than 30mins"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:33:05 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":"capped"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:23:40 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:27:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:27:17 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2010/10/18 11:27:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/10/18 11:33:05 +0100","ticket_id":22093361,"value":"0"}],"latest_recipients":"support+id1805@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":"2010/10/18 12:00:00 +0100","current_collaborators":null,"status_id":4,"field_148059":"authorized","description":"At your convenience!","organization_id":40584,"field_177410":null,"assignee_name":"Kieran Topping","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692462},{"problem_id":null,"nice_id":900,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/05/06 16:56:09 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","channel":null,"field_97116":".2","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/05/06 16:56:09 +0100","resolution_time":4007,"priority_id":0,"current_tags":"billable french","assignee_id":4323506,"updated_at":"2011/01/18 15:17:38 +0000","req_name":"Liz Goulding","ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2011/01/18 15:17:38 +0000","solved_at":"2010/10/20 15:29:34 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/05/11 16:56:23 +0100","linkings":[],"score":0,"via_id":0,"subject":"French: Some weird items appearing in the left nav","recipient":null,"group_id":45601,"submitter_id":3663591,"base_score":0,"comments":[{"created_at":"2010/05/06 16:56:09 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Some weird items appearing in the left nav of this page http://www.london2012.com/fr/nous-contacter.php - e.g. 'Page not found' is appearing there\r\n(split from Morag's ticket http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/874)\r\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3709935},{"created_at":"2010/05/11 16:56:23 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Ths secondary-nav here:\r\n  http://www.london2012.com/fr/nous-contacter.php\r\nlooks quite different to here:\r\n  http://www.london2012.com/contact-us.php\r\nIs it trivially fixable Janos?","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/05/11 17:36:53 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Not only fixable, fixed.
