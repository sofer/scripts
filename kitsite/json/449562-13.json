The ones that just contain scrolling text headlines and nearly always say ‘BREAKING NEWS’ on them?  We have one of those on the London 2012 live site big screens around the UK, and we’ve just been given permission by the BBC to put whatever information we want on them when the live sites are broadcasting London 2012 specific material (which is about 20 minutes every hour).\r\n \r\nThe ticker works by pulling in an RSS feed, and we were going to try and use our latest few news headlines and straplines. But after a few discussions our Comms team in general have decided that they’d like us to set up something a bit more complicated and we were wondering if you guys would be able to build this for us.\r\n \r\nWhat we’re looking for is (we imagine) a form with entry fields which we can populate which will generate RSS that the live sites can pull in to populate to ticker.  We were imagining that from our end it would be as simple as a form with, for example, 10 text-only entry boxes.

Would you have any idea how that would effect the feed running on the screen? E.g. might it jerk back to the beginning of the looped text? I don’t know if that’s something the BBC’s set up would dictate or not\n\n2) Should we want to expand on what’s been built so far, how difficult would the following be for you guys?:\n\n\na) Add the ability to set a start and end date on fields so that they are added and removed from the feed after running for a certain period.\n\nFor example, between April 1st and 3rd:\n\nField one says “Hello” and has no date settings\nField two says “Everybody” and is set to start at the beginning of April 1st and finish at the end of April 2nd\nField three says “How are you” and has a start date of the start of April 2nd and no end date\n\nApril 1st feed reads “Hello Everybody”\nApril 2nd feed reads “Hello Everybody How are you”\nApril 3rd onwards feed reads “Hello How are you”\n\n\nb) Add some titles to the fields so that we can assign them to different teams here (I presume that’s pretty easy)\n\n\n3) I assume there’s no character count on the fields?

The ones that just contain scrolling text headlines and nearly always say ‘BREAKING NEWS’ on them?  We have one of those on the London 2012 live site big screens around the UK, and we’ve just been given permission by the BBC to put whatever information we want on them when the live sites are broadcasting London 2012 specific material (which is about 20 minutes every hour).\r\n \r\nThe ticker works by pulling in an RSS feed, and we were going to try and use our latest few news headlines and straplines. But after a few discussions our Comms team in general have decided that they’d like us to set up something a bit more complicated and we were wondering if you guys would be able to build this for us.\r\n \r\nWhat we’re looking for is (we imagine) a form with entry fields which we can populate which will generate RSS that the live sites can pull in to populate to ticker.  We were imagining that from our end it would be as simple as a form with, for example, 10 text-only entry boxes. The form would recognise when fields were and weren’t populated and play the populated fields one by one in order, on a loop.\r\n \r\nSo, an example of what we might populate the fields with:\r\n \r\nField 1: 20th August 2010 – London 2012 has announced that pole dancing will now be the only Olympic sport\r\nField 2:\r\nField 3:\r\nField 4:\r\nField 5: 20th August 2010 – Usain Bolt bored of winning everything\r\nField 6:\r\nField 7:\r\nField 8:\r\nField 9: For all the latest news updates on London 2012 visit www.london2012.com, www.facebook.com/london2012, www.twitter.com/london2012\r\nField 10:\r\n \r\nIn this example, whenever we updated the form (and clicked a ‘submit’ button, or something?) it would recognise that certain fields were empty, and the RSS the form generated would populate the ticker with the populated fields consecutively.

I have briefed McCann to design this, but am wondering if it's something you can implement as you did with the Games Maker pages.\r\n\r\n* New map page to embed a 'Get Set' map similar to the one at http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/volunteer/games-maker-roles-and-venues/games-maker-venues.php I will send you the map when it is available - we would just need an International Inspiration template creating which could support it\r\n\r\n* Possible template tweak to content pages in the International Inspiration section - we would like all pages in the International Inspiration section to support a full-width banner similar to the ones in the Sport section http://www.london2012.com/games/olympic-sports/aquatics-diving.php Is this possible?\r\n\r\nGrateful for your thoughts on how long it will take to do the above.

Staging load-balancer\r\n\r\nhttp://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com is currently live to the general internet.\r\n\r\n* ActionPoint 1. Although this is beyond my remit, I would advise retricting access in some way - either at an apache level, or at the akamai level, or at an o/s or hardware firewall level.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Staging servers: stage03/04\r\n\r\n2.1. Apache\r\n\r\nCurrently, stage03/04's Apaches do NOT use NameVirtualHost's.\r\n\r\nI recommend that we SHOULD use NameVirtualHost's. If Apache is set up differently to web01/04 then it introduces a whole class of error that cannot be caught by testing in the staging environment.\r\n\r\n* ActionPoint 2. Can stage03/04 have Apache set up to use NameVirtualHost's please? We currently only need one host set up: vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com.\r\n\r\n2. Rsync\r\n\r\nCurrently, stage03 is NOT synced with stage04.\r\n\r\n* ActionPoint 3. Can stage03 be periodically synced with stage04 (in the same way as web01 is synced with web02,3,4) please?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I kindly request that these issues be addressed as urgently as is possible?\r\n\r\nI ask, because the absence of the staging environment is preventing us from launching any new functionality (of which there is now a sizable backlog). This does not impact Kitsite, per se, but is likely to cause some issues very soon for locog staff (for example, I believe there is an important splash page required for next Friday, which we cannot promote without the staging environment in place).\r\n\r\nThanks, in advance,\r\n\r\nKieran\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/08 12:26:30 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Internal notes:\r\n\r\nLoad-balancer\r\n=============\r\n\r\n http://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com\r\nCurrently live, but will presumably soon be restricted.\r\n\r\nnslookup suggests that this corresponds to: e3955.g.akamaiedge.net, which - presumably - means that stage03/04 are now behind the akamai load-balancer/cache.\r\n\r\n \r\nServers: stage03/04\r\n===================\r\n\r\n 213.120.228.148\r\n 213.120.228.149\r\n\r\nAccess\r\n------\r\nHave same ssh-access rules as web01.\r\n username: webcontent\r\n password: same as web01\r\n accessible from milo\r\n\r\nApache\r\n------\r\nCurrently, stage03/04's apaches do NOT use NameVirtualHost's.\r\nHave requested that they DO use NameVirtualHost's (as per email, attached).\r\n \r\nRsync\r\n-----\r\nCurrently, stage03 is NOT synced with stage04.\r\nHave requested that this be enabled (as per email, attached)\r\n\r\n\r\nBase-hrefs\r\n==========\r\nThese are now written dynamically - i.e. in php, by checking the value of $_SERVER[\"SERVER_NAME\"].

Jag:\r\n\r\nHi all\r\nIt would be best to continue the work on the Staging servers once Jamie is back from holiday.  I think a lot of what has been asked may have already been implemented...\r\nWe can then schedule a conf call with BT/LOCOG/Kitsite.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n2. Kieran:\r\n\r\nI am up to speed with what has already been implemented. The requests that I have recently made are for further enhancements to the current environment.\r\nWe can - of course - wait until next week, however my concern is that the 3 or 4 substantial pieces of work that we are waiting to launch will now be further delayed. As I indicated before, this does not impact us, but will impact the editorial team adversely.\r\nI believe, for example, that a new ticketing promo is due to go live tomorrow, and a new splash page on Friday, regarding ticket pricing. I presume these are immovable deadlines (Danny, perhaps you could confirm?).\r\nPerhaps this might be a time to suggest (on the editorial team's behalf) dropping the requirement for all new work to go through the staging environment until such a time as we actually have an operational staging environment?\r\nKieran\r\n\r\n3. Jag:\r\n\r\nKeiran\r\nIt was discussed that the ticketing splash page can be done as usual – as was done for volunteering. So this should not be impacted.\r\nCould you let me know what additional pieces of work are scheduled?\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n4. Kieran:\r\n- Hide quoted text -\r\n\r\n* Chartbeat tags (work complete, but on hold)\r\n* Shop (work complete, but on hold)\r\n* Search bug: http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/1613 (fix ready, but on hold)\r\n* Change to ticket promo (changes launched in absence of staging)\r\n* Splash page. If you're just talking about the switching off/on of the splash page, then that's great that there's a process in place. If I'm to understand it correctly, though, the new splash page itself should be okayed on the staging server before going live?\r\n\r\nWe are very keen to ensure that we meet your staging requirements, but we're also very keen to push this current backlog live, and are thus happy to be advised - on a case-by-case basis - if certain projects can be launched without going through staging.\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/13 15:37:16 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Perhaps this ticket should be closed: http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/1537\r\n(and/or merged)","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/13 15:44:35 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"or vice versa :-)","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/10/13 15:46:00 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":19,"value":"Ticket #1537 \"Set up staging environment [was:...\" was closed and merged into this ticket.\r\n\r\nLast Comment in #1537: Status update: awaiting a conference call with BT","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/10/19 16:41:17 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Preparation and conf. call with Jag, today discussing forwarding our requirements for setting up apache to BT/IPSOFT.\r\nJamie 45min, Kieran 45min, Total 0.2\r\n\r\n(possibly more to come today, as Jag is sending a group email for annotation)","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/26 12:50:54 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Another email to Jag (as Jag didn't send his group email for annotation)\r\nKieran 45min (0.1)\r\nRunning total to follow...","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/26 12:54:40 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"1.5 Kieran: (Oct 4-8)\r\n0.1 Kieran: email Oct 11\r\n0.1 Kieran: email Oct 13\r\n0.2 Jamie,Kieran conf. call Oct 19\r\n0.1 Kieran: 26 Oct Another email to Jag.\r\n\r\nRUNNING TOTAL\r\n2.0 days\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/10/27 11:39:53 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"1.5 Kieran: (Oct 4-8)\r\n0.1 Kieran: email Oct 11\r\n0.1 Kieran: email Oct 13\r\n0.2 Jamie,Kieran conf. call Oct 19\r\n0.1 Kieran: 26 Oct Another email to Jag.\r\n0.2 Kieran: 27 Oct Another email to Jag / phone discussion w.
