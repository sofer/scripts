I have no strong preference to them being used this way, this just what I sort of expected based on previous emails)\r\n\r\nI realise that one of the main criteria you are hoping to use it for is testing of the load balancers and Apache configs (which will be immensely useful) and therefore you possibly weren't seeing them as part of the live (everyday) publication workflow, maybe you were? once again happy to use them either way.\r\n\r\nObviously if we have a static / self contained website it is very easy to just place it on the staging servers, see if it works and then copy it across to the live servers if it does.\r\n\r\nHowever when we have a new section of the main site (like /get-involved/volunteering) that is intrinsically tied to other pages on the main site / shares components with the live CMS and utilises feeds running on the live CMS it is not quite so simple to separate out the site to a separate server.\r\n\r\nThe approach I have outlined in the diagram below (and in my email last week) re-routes the current publication from \"CMS to web01\" to \"CMS to staging server01\" this gives us an opportunity to limit the RSYNC (completely, by file type or by section) between the staging environment and web01 and therefore view the site on the staging servers first.\r\n\r\nThe downside of this approach is that staging 01 and 02 become part of the publication workflow and therefore if they are unavailable publication will break.\r\n\r\nA complete shutdown of the rsync will also hold up everyday editorial publication, therefore I suggest we look at an intelligent way of limiting what is automatically rynced and what has to be pushed by hand.\r\n\r\nI think we probably also need to decide which of these the new servers is really (or most importantly) for:\r\n\r\n- testing out config changes to Apache and/or the load balancer and Akamai\r\n- testing out standalone new sites\r\n- a real time mirror of the live environment that all changes have first to pass though (question around delays to editorial publication and how we deal with these)\r\n- limiting the automatic syncing to the live environment of certain kinds of global files (css / js etc.)\r\n- limiting the automatic syncing to the live environment of certain sections\r\n- limiting the automatic syncing to the live environment  completely in the case of a relaunch (question around delays to editorial publication and how we deal with these)\r\n\r\nThe one big question that needs clarifying I think is whether we expect these servers to be part of the live everyday production workflow (if they are, we can't just turn them off / reboot them at will) or do they simply hold a 'clone' of the existing published site (ie. whatever is on web01 although that does imply they are only useful for testing config changes and not 'staging').\r\n\r\nI have included on the diagram our existing / internal dev/staging environment for completeness, what is important to note here is that the editorial content on this server is not the same as the live content, it is a periodic clone of the content held in the CMS, which makes it useful for development/testing but not for handling a real time staging->production workflow. \r\n\r\nJamie\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603}],"linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":1,"status_updated_at":"2010/09/07 13:16:31 +0100","solved_at":"2010/06/09 12:30:08 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"bill_to_its","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/06/01 10:24:17 +0100","channel":null,"via_id":0,"subject":"ITS: Feedback on server environment for volunteering site","recipient":null,"group_id":61946,"submitter_id":3640926,"base_score":0,"latest_recipients":null,"due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/06/01 10:24:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/06/01 10:24:17 +0100","ticket_id":12699904,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/06/01 10:24:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/06/09 12:30:07 +0100","ticket_id":12699904,"value":"0.4"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/06/01 10:24:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/06/01 10:24:17 +0100","ticket_id":12699904,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/06/01 10:24:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/07/26 12:48:16 +0100","ticket_id":12699904,"value":"bill_to_its"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/06/01 10:24:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/06/01 10:24:17 +0100","ticket_id":12699904,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/06/01 10:24:17 +0100","updated_at":"2010/06/09 12:30:07 +0100","ticket_id":12699904,"value":"0.4"}],"status_id":4,"field_148059":"","description":"[see recent email correspondence -

We now have one solution for ANY domain.\n\nHi Liz,\n\nI just tested one new solution and it worked first time, with the \nadded bonus that it's all much simpler as well. No PHP needed.\n\n2 files are attached:\n- links-list.js: Liz, this is the JSON formatted file where you will \nbe managing the links, please take a look and let me know if it makes \nsense. The # should be replaced with the microsite link.\n- theming.js: Jamie, Check the \"Some techie info for Jamie\" section \nbelow for the changes I've made to this file.\n\nSo:\n- The JavaScript calls a file on another domain.\n\n- This cross domain file is the JSON content (which you will need to \nedit to add the drop down menu links) wrapped in a *JavaScript function.\n\n- Once the cross domain file is returned, our local JavaScript uses \nits JSON content to populate the HTML drop down.\n\nJob done!\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\n*For some reason calling the JSON content didn't work cross domain, \nbut calling a JavaScript function does. So we simply wrap the JSON in \na JavaScript function\n\n\nSome techie info for Jamie.\n\nThe microsite content I delivered contained this code below (which \nlinked to a PHP script):\n\n\t$.getJSON(\"../includes/cross-domain.php\", function(data){\n\t\t$.each(data.links.link, function(){\n\t\t\t$(\"div.drop-down ul\").append('<li><a href=\"' +\n$(this).attr(\"url\") \n+ '\">' + $(this).attr(\"name\") + '</a></li>');\n\t\t});\t\n\t});\n\nThat should be changed to this one line (replacing the URL with the \nfinal LOCOG location):\n\n\t\n$.getJSON(\"http://www.cogapp.com/temp/locog/json/links-list.js?callback=\n\n?\");\n\nIn the cross domain JavaScript file (attached) you'll see we've \nwrapped the JSON content in a JavaScript function \"linkData\":\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n \nThis E-mail is confidential.

We now have one solution for ANY domain.\n\nHi Liz,\n\nI just tested one new solution and it worked first time, with the \nadded bonus that it's all much simpler as well. No PHP needed.\n\n2 files are attached:\n- links-list.js: Liz, this is the JSON formatted file where you will \nbe managing the links, please take a look and let me know if it makes \nsense. The # should be replaced with the microsite link.\n- theming.js: Jamie, Check the \"Some techie info for Jamie\" section \nbelow for the changes I've made to this file.\n\nSo:\n- The JavaScript calls a file on another domain.\n\n- This cross domain file is the JSON content (which you will need to \nedit to add the drop down menu links) wrapped in a *JavaScript function.\n\n- Once the cross domain file is returned, our local JavaScript uses \nits JSON content to populate the HTML drop down.\n\nJob done!\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\n*For some reason calling the JSON content didn't work cross domain, \nbut calling a JavaScript function does. So we simply wrap the JSON in \na JavaScript function\n\n\nSome techie info for Jamie.\n\nThe microsite content I delivered contained this code below (which \nlinked to a PHP script):\n\n\t$.getJSON(\"../includes/cross-domain.php\", function(data){\n\t\t$.each(data.links.link, function(){\n\t\t\t$(\"div.drop-down ul\").append('<li><a href=\"' +\n$(this).attr(\"url\") \n+ '\">' + $(this).attr(\"name\") + '</a></li>');\n\t\t});\t\n\t});\n\nThat should be changed to this one line (replacing the URL with the \nfinal LOCOG location):\n\n\t\n$.getJSON(\"http://www.cogapp.com/temp/locog/json/links-list.js?callback=\n\n?\");\n\nIn the cross domain JavaScript file (attached) you'll see we've \nwrapped the JSON content in a JavaScript function \"linkData\":\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n \nThis E-mail is confidential.
