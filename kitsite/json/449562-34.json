There are two different things being talked about here.\r\n\r\n1. \"Republishing the site\" is a task which arises relatively often. Upon this occasion, I spent a small amount of extra time developing a routine that we can run on the next occasion which will result in our billable time being zero. This, I have billed for.\r\n\r\n2. The \"optimization\" that Danny mentioned was not technically related to this ticket, and - as such - is probably confusing matters. What happened was that I noticed that some pages were slow to publish (Events pages, fwiw) and spent some time speeding them up (massively; i.e. from about 10 sec each to about 1 sec each). This led to the actual process of publication being much quicker. This I did NOT bill for (as - you're right - it was neither requested nor authorized).\r\n\r\nI hope this makes sense?\r\nKieran\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2010/03/25 09:20:33 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Let's close this!\n\n \n\nLiz Goulding\n\nNew Media Producer\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\n\nDirect line: +44 (0) 203 2012 297\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nwww.london2012.com  \n\nwww.twitter.com/london2012 \n\n________________________________\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3709935},{"created_at":"2010/03/26 17:56:25 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Marking as authorized, but, Liz, your comments are noted and we agree that we need to be more careful about getting anything but the smallest bits of work (<0.1  day?) signed off before proceeding.\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926}],"linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":4,"status_updated_at":"2010/05/24 12:15:55 +0100","solved_at":"2010/03/25 10:49:30 +0000","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/03/15 13:44:58 +0000","channel":null,"via_id":0,"subject":"Site republish","recipient":null,"group_id":61946,"submitter_id":3640926,"base_score":0,"latest_recipients":"support+id690@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":"2010/03/22 12:00:00 +0000","current_collaborators":null,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/03/19 11:07:45 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/19 11:07:45 +0000","ticket_id":8983226,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/03/15 13:44:58 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/22 10:07:12 +0000","ticket_id":8983226,"value":"0.3"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/03/19 11:07:45 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/19 11:07:45 +0000","ticket_id":8983226,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/03/19 11:07:45 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/19 11:07:45 +0000","ticket_id":8983226,"value":"billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/03/19 11:07:45 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/26 17:56:24 +0000","ticket_id":8983226,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/03/15 13:44:58 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/23 10:08:14 +0000","ticket_id":8983226,"value":"0.3"}],"status_id":4,"field_148059":"authorized","description":"We need to republish the site in a way that minimises disruption in order to be ready to put the ticketing nav live for launch on Monday (as well as to be able to put live other work that is completed).\r\n\r\nSee:\r\nhttp://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/664\r\nhttp://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/645\r\n","problem_id":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"0.3","assignee_name":"Kieran Topping","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3709935},{"nice_id":716,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/03/19 12:40:28 +0000","field_358835":"","field_110059":"","field_97116":".6","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/03/19 12:40:28 +0000","score":0,"resolution_time":129,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":null,"assignee_id":4323506,"updated_at":"2010/05/23 23:15:58 +0100","req_name":"Morag Reavley","comments":[{"created_at":"2010/03/19 12:40:28 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"The Government Office Region field is derived from the post code.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2010/03/23 14:26:12 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"there were some issues with the government office region data, but now it looks all happy and being imported to communicator corp slowly.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":4323506},{"created_at":"2010/03/24 18:34:53 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Great - thanks!
