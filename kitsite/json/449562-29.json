This is a technical task, but should be fairly easy for anyone with basic technical knowledge to do, please let me know if you woudl like some more detailed instructions on this; it may make sense to add them to any 'emergency plan' you have.\r\n\r\nii) An emergency site, in case of well, emergencies. I guess the two things you are covering here are \r\n\r\na) the facility to have ready / put up a simple site in case of a major issue or news story and you just want all attention focused on that and not the site as a whole \r\n\r\nb) an issue with networks etc. and you just want a site you can edit by hand [it should be noted you can already edit 99% of the site by hand as it is all HTML/PHP on the live severs].\r\n\r\nIf you create a small site within /temporary/pages/html/ (or any other directory) we can write up some notes for you on how we would \r\n\r\na) switch to it and\r\nb) how you could edit it on the live servers directly if need be.\r\n\r\nThe third thing you may want is a copy of that emergency site synced to a server *outside* of the main server environment, this is something I haven't covered in this ticket but may be worth considering.  \r\n\r\nSo the things not covered in this ticket (which you may want to open a separate ticket for, but may want to discuss first) are:\r\n\r\n- documentation on switching to maintenance mode for 3rd parties (above what is described above, this will have a technical element) \r\n- documentation on switching to an emergency site for 3rd parties (above what is described above, this will have a technical element) \r\n- editing of the emergency site direct on the live server and how to sync content to the rest of the farm (familiarity with HTML and FTP will be required as will access the the servers, you may need to decide who and how people get access to the live servers to make sure we don't breach any security implications)\r\n- synchronization of emergency site to a 3rd party server (it may be that you want this server outside of BT's network to cover all eventualities)\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nSwitching to a temp page for maintenance, this is commented otu in .htaccess at the root of the site\r\n\r\n# -- TEMPORARY / MAINTINANCE

First instalment:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. No related photos at all any more?\r\nThere were no related photos appearing. This was because the CMS was looking for French-language photo pages (of which we have none). I have amended the code so that it - instead - looks for English-language photo pages. We will need to republish the French section in order for this to take effect on the live site. However, for the meantime you can confirm it's working in the CMS here:\r\n  http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/fr/news/2009/11/le-cio-est-tres-positif-au-sujet-de-l-avancement-des-travaux-de-londres-2012.php\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Top nav section 'Séjour' is listed as 'Visitier en 2012' in all breadcrumbs for that section\r\nThis is an upshot of the fact that it was felt that there was a need to shorten\r\n\"Visiter en 2012\" to \"Séjour\" in the top nav. If this means that the whole\r\nsection needs to be renamed \"Séjour\" then ... that is fine, but it's not my call\r\n- in fact it's probably not even your call (as such) but a question for\r\ntranslatios.com. The question(s) specifically being:\r\n a) Is it appropriate to entitle the section \"Séjour\", and for it to appear as\r\n such in the breadcrumb.\r\n b) If so, and if it is appropriate, can they undertake to always translate \"Visiting in 2012\" as \"Séjour\".\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1 http://www.london2012.com/fr/photos/ Search box and button in right-hand column are in English\r\nThe Search box has been fixed. The search \"button\" is in fact a gif.\r\nThe button is a gif. See:\r\n http://www.london2012.com/images/presentation/search-blue-on-white.gif.\r\nCan we request a French language gif from you? Presumably saying \"Rechercher\".\r\n\r\n3.2 Your photos\r\nWe are unclear what you would like to do with the \"Your photos\" links. Should\r\nthey simply be disabled (they're pointing to English-language pages)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. http://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/planning-consultations/index.php Text in body doesn't point out that Greenwich Park and Earl's Court consultation sites are in English only\r\nThis is because the English language page contains hard-coded links to pages. i.e. links that have been chosen by directly specifying an entire url in the link-picker (one of which - in fact - is a short url). As such, these links are NOT under content management, so we have no simple way of knowing that we should display an \"(en anglais uniquement)\" disclaimer. \r\n\r\nIf necessary, we can search for other such occurrences, and provide you with a list, so they can be manually fixed. However, I think that this is outside of the immediate scope of the French site. Please correct me if I'm wrong here.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. http://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environmental-monitoring/rapports-de-surveillance.php: text doesn't highlight that reports are in english\r\nIf you're talking about the following links:\r\n   http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ \"Hackney\"\r\n   http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/ \"Tower Hamlets\"\r\n   http://www.walthamforest.gov.uk/ \"Waltham Forest\"\r\n   http://www.newham.gov.uk/ \"Newham\"\r\nthen we don't really have a way of knowing whether any particular editorially-chosen external link is in French or English. This might be something that you might want to direct Translations.com to do? i.e. to \"Examine any external links and - if they're English-only, then append \"(en anglais uniquement)\".

The question(s) specifically being:\n\na) Is it appropriate to entitle the section \"Séjour\", and for it to appear as such in the breadcrumb.\n\nb) If so, and if it is appropriate, can they undertake to always translate \"Visiting in 2012\" as \"Séjour\".\n\n3) Is it ok for Kieran to send the Paralympic pages for translation? 20 pages in total.\n\n-----Original Message-----\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3734551},{"created_at":"2010/05/11 16:04:39 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Each French issue now has its own ticket.\r\nI have created new tickets for each of Morag's issues (but not for the ones in this here ticket - If there are any outstanding/serious issues in this ticket, please raise a new ticket - one per issue).\r\nThanks, Kieran\r\n(No days allocated to this ticket, as it has been billed for elsewhere).","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591}],"linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2010/08/09 16:17:28 +0100","solved_at":"2010/05/11 16:04:39 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/03/15 16:09:05 +0000","channel":null,"via_id":0,"subject":"French site amendments","recipient":null,"group_id":61946,"submitter_id":4323506,"base_score":0,"latest_recipients":"support+id687@postcms.zendesk.com Liz.Goulding@london2012.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","ticket_id":8977683,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","updated_at":"2010/05/11 16:04:22 +0100","ticket_id":8977683,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","ticket_id":8977683,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","ticket_id":8977683,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","updated_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","ticket_id":8977683,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/03/15 11:05:18 +0000","updated_at":"2010/05/11 16:04:23 +0100","ticket_id":8977683,"value":"0"}],"status_id":4,"field_148059":"","description":"Hi Janos, plenty more amendments required please\r\n\r\nGeneral stuff\r\n\r\n- No related photos at all anymore?\r\n\r\n- Top nav section 'Sejour' is listed as 'Visitier en 2012' in all \r\nbreadcrumbs for that section\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/photos/\r\n\r\n- search box and button in right-hand column are in English\r\n\r\n- your photos\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/planning-consultations/ind \r\nex.php\r\n\r\n- Text in body doesn't point out that Greenwich Park and Earl's Court \r\nconsultation sites are in English only\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environment \r\nal-monitoring/bruit.php\r\n\r\n- alt tags in pictures in body in english\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environment \r\nal-monitoring/poussiere.php\r\n\r\n- alt tags in pictures in body in english\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environment \r\nal-monitoring/rapports-de-surveillance.php\r\n\r\n- text doesn't highlight that reports are in english\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/infrastructure/technologie \r\n.php\r\n\r\n- empty apart from main picture, this page is populated on the English \r\nsite though\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/\r\n\r\n- No Venues in pull down list\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/venues/index.php\r\n\r\n- No venues present on page, just categories of venues\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/olympic-sports/index.php\r\n\r\n- Olympic sports not in alphabetical order (E's at the end)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/olympic-sports/badminton.php\r\n\r\n- 'Qui' pictures not corresponding to information (picture of man is \r\nAnthony Clark, not Susan Susanti')\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/olympic-sports/boxe.php\r\n\r\n- Same, picture of Bradley Saunders listed as being Muhammed Ali.
