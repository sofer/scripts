(ie Young Leaders/blog/posts) - i'm not sure how to move it.\n\nThanks\n\nDeborah\n\n[cid:image001.png@01CAF04F.3EC1C790]\n\nDeborah Elstein\nCopywriter\nCommunications and Public Affairs\nDirect line:  +44 (0)20 3 2012 109\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nOne Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\nlondon2012.com\n\n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email","channel":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"0","assignee_name":"Lars Bortfeldt","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692169},{"score":0,"nice_id":791,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/04/01 14:36:55 +0100","field_358835":"","field_110059":"","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/04/01 14:26:53 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/01 14:26:53 +0100","ticket_id":9734886,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/04/14 11:49:09 +0100","updated_at":"2010/05/13 12:23:10 +0100","ticket_id":9734886,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/04/01 14:26:53 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/01 14:26:53 +0100","ticket_id":9734886,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/04/01 14:26:53 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/14 11:49:09 +0100","ticket_id":9734886,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/04/01 14:26:53 +0100","updated_at":"2010/04/01 14:26:53 +0100","ticket_id":9734886,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/04/14 11:49:09 +0100","updated_at":"2010/05/13 12:23:10 +0100","ticket_id":9734886,"value":"0"}],"field_97116":"0","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/04/01 14:26:52 +0100","comments":[{"created_at":"2010/04/01 14:26:52 +0100","attachments":[{"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/9s5im2mier75mqc/?name=image001.jpg","size":81497,"created_at":"2010/04/01 14:26:53 +0100","content_type":"image/jpeg","token":"9s5im2mier75mqc","id":4309436,"filename":"image001.jpg","is_public":true}],"via_id":4,"value":"CAn you refresh and see what happens?

Can we extend the same footer which appears on the Home page so that it runs throughout the Young Leaders site?\r\n\r\nthanks!","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2010/05/11 10:51:35 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Is it possible please to add this Flash video at the top of the 'About' page http://89.234.19.19/twentytwelve/young_leaders_programme/young_leaders_programme_blog.swf\r\n \r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2010/05/11 13:42:37 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"The video is there now!","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3690996},{"created_at":"2010/05/11 14:05:23 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"The Meet the Young Leaders grid is being populated by the Young leaders profiles grouped by Team and limited to 5 ( as per design ).\r\n\r\nAs for the team of the week slot, i'm not sure how we could automate this ( because we chose to not use a taxonomy for the teams ).

First instalment:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. No related photos at all any more?\r\nThere were no related photos appearing. This was because the CMS was looking for French-language photo pages (of which we have none). I have amended the code so that it - instead - looks for English-language photo pages. We will need to republish the French section in order for this to take effect on the live site. However, for the meantime you can confirm it's working in the CMS here:\r\n  http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/fr/news/2009/11/le-cio-est-tres-positif-au-sujet-de-l-avancement-des-travaux-de-londres-2012.php\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Top nav section 'Séjour' is listed as 'Visitier en 2012' in all breadcrumbs for that section\r\nThis is an upshot of the fact that it was felt that there was a need to shorten\r\n\"Visiter en 2012\" to \"Séjour\" in the top nav. If this means that the whole\r\nsection needs to be renamed \"Séjour\" then ... that is fine, but it's not my call\r\n- in fact it's probably not even your call (as such) but a question for\r\ntranslatios.com. The question(s) specifically being:\r\n a) Is it appropriate to entitle the section \"Séjour\", and for it to appear as\r\n such in the breadcrumb.\r\n b) If so, and if it is appropriate, can they undertake to always translate \"Visiting in 2012\" as \"Séjour\".\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1 http://www.london2012.com/fr/photos/ Search box and button in right-hand column are in English\r\nThe Search box has been fixed. The search \"button\" is in fact a gif.\r\nThe button is a gif. See:\r\n http://www.london2012.com/images/presentation/search-blue-on-white.gif.\r\nCan we request a French language gif from you? Presumably saying \"Rechercher\".\r\n\r\n3.2 Your photos\r\nWe are unclear what you would like to do with the \"Your photos\" links. Should\r\nthey simply be disabled (they're pointing to English-language pages)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. http://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/planning-consultations/index.php Text in body doesn't point out that Greenwich Park and Earl's Court consultation sites are in English only\r\nThis is because the English language page contains hard-coded links to pages. i.e. links that have been chosen by directly specifying an entire url in the link-picker (one of which - in fact - is a short url). As such, these links are NOT under content management, so we have no simple way of knowing that we should display an \"(en anglais uniquement)\" disclaimer. \r\n\r\nIf necessary, we can search for other such occurrences, and provide you with a list, so they can be manually fixed. However, I think that this is outside of the immediate scope of the French site. Please correct me if I'm wrong here.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. http://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environmental-monitoring/rapports-de-surveillance.php: text doesn't highlight that reports are in english\r\nIf you're talking about the following links:\r\n   http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ \"Hackney\"\r\n   http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/ \"Tower Hamlets\"\r\n   http://www.walthamforest.gov.uk/ \"Waltham Forest\"\r\n   http://www.newham.gov.uk/ \"Newham\"\r\nthen we don't really have a way of knowing whether any particular editorially-chosen external link is in French or English. This might be something that you might want to direct Translations.com to do? i.e. to \"Examine any external links and - if they're English-only, then append \"(en anglais uniquement)\".

The question(s) specifically being:\n\na) Is it appropriate to entitle the section \"Séjour\", and for it to appear as such in the breadcrumb.\n\nb) If so, and if it is appropriate, can they undertake to always translate \"Visiting in 2012\" as \"Séjour\".\n\n3) Is it ok for Kieran to send the Paralympic pages for translation? 20 pages in total.\n\n-----Original Message-----\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3734551},{"created_at":"2010/05/11 16:04:39 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Each French issue now has its own ticket.\r\nI have created new tickets for each of Morag's issues (but not for the ones in this here ticket - If there are any outstanding/serious issues in this ticket, please raise a new ticket - one per issue).\r\nThanks, Kieran\r\n(No days allocated to this ticket, as it has been billed for elsewhere).","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591}],"resolution_time":1372,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"alt","assignee_id":3663591,"linkings":[],"updated_at":"2010/08/09 16:17:28 +0100","req_name":"Finn Concannon","ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2010/08/09 16:17:28 +0100","solved_at":"2010/05/11 16:04:39 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/03/15 16:09:05 +0000","via_id":0,"subject":"French site amendments","recipient":null,"group_id":61946,"submitter_id":4323506,"base_score":0,"latest_recipients":"support+id687@postcms.zendesk.com Liz.Goulding@london2012.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"problem_id":null,"status_id":4,"field_148059":"","description":"Hi Janos, plenty more amendments required please\r\n\r\nGeneral stuff\r\n\r\n- No related photos at all anymore?\r\n\r\n- Top nav section 'Sejour' is listed as 'Visitier en 2012' in all \r\nbreadcrumbs for that section\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/photos/\r\n\r\n- search box and button in right-hand column are in English\r\n\r\n- your photos\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/planning-consultations/ind \r\nex.php\r\n\r\n- Text in body doesn't point out that Greenwich Park and Earl's Court \r\nconsultation sites are in English only\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environment \r\nal-monitoring/bruit.php\r\n\r\n- alt tags in pictures in body in english\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environment \r\nal-monitoring/poussiere.php\r\n\r\n- alt tags in pictures in body in english\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/sustainability/environment \r\nal-monitoring/rapports-de-surveillance.php\r\n\r\n- text doesn't highlight that reports are in english\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/making-it-happen/infrastructure/technologie \r\n.php\r\n\r\n- empty apart from main picture, this page is populated on the English \r\nsite though\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/\r\n\r\n- No Venues in pull down list\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/venues/index.php\r\n\r\n- No venues present on page, just categories of venues\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/olympic-sports/index.php\r\n\r\n- Olympic sports not in alphabetical order (E's at the end)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/olympic-sports/badminton.php\r\n\r\n- 'Qui' pictures not corresponding to information (picture of man is \r\nAnthony Clark, not Susan Susanti')\r\n\r\nhttp://www.london2012.com/fr/games/olympic-sports/boxe.php\r\n\r\n- Same, picture of Bradley Saunders listed as being Muhammed Ali.
