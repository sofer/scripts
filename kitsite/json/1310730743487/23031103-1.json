His specific comments as follows:\n\n“I typically deploy the following two rules on every web project that I work on:\n1. 301 all requests with no subdomain specified to the www. equivalent of the URL (e.g. a request for london2012.com should 301 to www.london2012.com and a request for london2012.com/sports should 301 to www.london2012.com).\n2. 301 all requests with uppercase characters to their lower case equivalent. (e.g. a request for www.london2012.com/Sports would redirect to www.london2012.com/sports) - before implementing this ensure that canonical URL can only be specified with lower case characters.\nSimple Apache rules exist to implement this logic. Once the rules are in place a request for london2012.com/Sports would redirect to www.london2012.com/sports.”\n\nKieran, can you comment on doability?\n\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":18087822}],"channel":null,"updated_at":"2011/06/29 11:39:33 +0100","req_name":"Liz Goulding","ticket_type_id":1,"status_updated_at":"2011/04/18 11:29:32 +0100","solved_at":null,"original_recipient_address":null,"field_147056":"","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/04/18 11:29:32 +0100","via_id":4,"subject":"re-opening case sensitive URLs","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","group_id":61946,"score":60,"submitter_id":3709935,"base_score":60,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","ticket_id":63427566,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/04/18 11:29:32 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/18 11:29:32 +0100","ticket_id":63427566,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","ticket_id":63427566,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","ticket_id":63427566,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","ticket_id":63427566,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/04/18 11:29:32 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/18 11:29:32 +0100","ticket_id":63427566,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/04/18 11:29:32 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/18 11:29:32 +0100","ticket_id":63427566,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","ticket_id":63427566,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","ticket_id":63427566,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","ticket_id":63427566,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","ticket_id":63427566,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/18 10:33:00 +0100","ticket_id":63427566,"value":"0"}],"latest_recipients":"support+id3661@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"status_id":1,"description":"Hi guys,\n\nI believe you fixed this back in Jan or so ... but it now appears to not be working again:\n\nhttp://www.london2012.com/Get-Involved - 404\nwhen it should redirect you to get-involved, I believe?\n\nLiz\n\nLiz Goulding\nSenior New Media Producer\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\nDirect line: +44 (0) 203 2012 297\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\nwww.london2012.comhttp://www.london2012.com\nwww.twitter.com/london2012http://www.twitter.com/london2012\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

Is it possible to add a break within the text so that not all the text shows on the index page (as per our normal blog)?\n\n3. Can you remind me how we assign a team name / avatar to a blog post – can we just enter them as normal authors i.e. Aberdeen instead of a person’s name?

The 'profile pictures' bar didn't render properly, rather than the yellow scroll left/right buttons there is a vertical standard scroll. (fig.1)\n\n2.       The team sub pages don't load - giving a 400 page not found error (fig.2). The links contain the same addresses but won't display in IE6 for some reason.\n\n\nAll browsers had one rendering issue, on the 'team' pages there were underscores between the 'profile pictures' (fig.3)\n\nOther than these issues the pages are fine and I see no problem with them being pushed live.\n\nTom\n\n\nFig.1\n[cid:image002.jpg@01CBFB5F.C3D8A090]\n\n\nFig.2\n[cid:image003.jpg@01CBFB5F.C3D8A090]\n\n\nFig.3\n[cid:image004.jpg@01CBFB5F.C3D8A090]\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

The para returns are not showing on the index page – all the text runs as one.\n\n2. Is it possible to add a break within the text so that not all the text shows on the index page (as per our normal blog)?\n\n3. Can you remind me how we assign a team name / avatar to a blog post – can we just enter them as normal authors i.e. Aberdeen instead of a person’s name? [You did tell me this but I have forgotten...]\n\n4. Meet the Young Leaders landing page http://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/young-leaders/meet/ - the yellow arrows at the top of the scrolling device don’t look quite right – are they supposed to sit on thumbnail photos like this?\n\nAlso – on the live site, something very odd has happened with the news feed top right:\nhttp://www.london2012.com/young-leaders/index.php You can’t see the actual news stories, just ‘More’, plus when you click ‘More’ it takes you to a French news story. This is not right – please can you investigate asap?\n\n[cid:image001.png@01CBEF93.4C342D70]\n\nFrom: Lars Bortfeldt [mailto:notifications-support@postcms.zendesk.com]\nSent: 11 May 2010 15:33\nTo: Morag Reavley\nSubject: [PostCMS support] Re: Young Leaders website","organization_id":40584,"assignee_name":"Lars Bortfeldt","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3692462},{"nice_id":3182,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/03/21 11:04:38 +0000","field_110059":"","problem_id":null,"entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/03/21 10:03:20 +0000","linkings":[],"resolution_time":null,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"video","assignee_id":3686603,"comments":[{"created_at":"2011/03/21 10:03:20 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Hello\n\nWe have a number of BSL videos in the Ticketing section e.g. http://www.london2012.com/visiting/tickets/information-in-bsl-about-london-2012-tickets/home-bsl-information.php\n\nIn the Other videos strip at the bottom, I would like all the other BSL ticketing videos to appear - but currently only the same video as already shown on that page appears in 'Other videos'.
