However when you use an iFrame, the iFrame itself is effectively the browser window, so that while the 'next' may load - pre scrolled to the top of the iFrame window - the page holding the IFrame will stay static.\n\nI f that is the issue you are experiencing I think GDP need to add something similar to this (not necessarily exactly this, but this is along the right track) to their iFrame page.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3805243/jquery-scroll-to-top-of-iframe-parent\n\nSo yes it is something that needs to be fixed at GDP's end, although the issue probably only presents itself when the page is displayed inside an iFrame (and step 2 is deeper than step 3)\n\nHope that makes sense, it's much easier to 'show' that describe in an email !!\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"attachments":[],"created_at":"2012/03/02 11:06:11 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Actually what I suggested probaly won't work as the GDP page is on a different domain and a page loaded iFrame from a different domain isn't allowed to control the 'parent' window (for security reasons).\n\nIt's not ideal (especially at this late stage) but the solution is probably to change the design so that each step is of a similar size/height, ideally a size/height that is always visible in the iFrame (so that you dont' hit a situation where a user scrolls down to see the bottom of step 2 and then hits 'next' and has to scroll back up the page to see step 3).","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"attachments":[],"created_at":"2012/03/02 14:56:34 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Morag,\n\nJust realised that I didn't email you earlier to say we had extended the height of the iFrame\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"attachments":[],"created_at":"2012/03/02 14:59:50 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Saw it!

I think we should be tagging articles to Culture, Ceremonies and/or Torch Relay and if we need to group them in the navigation then do that there. Is 'Round the UK' really a tag, or just a grouping for articles that don't fit into any of the above categories?\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, tthe reason we are re-using the 'Theme' taxonomy is that, that is the taxonomy also used by other pages on the site including Photos, Videos etc. so if we want related images and videos to tie in with News and Blog pages it doent' make sense to have two taxonomies / tags (unless you want to also re-tag all the photos and videos)\r\n\r\nThe one danger / issue here is where we have News articles that are already tagged to the theme Taxonomy (as obv. we are not differentiating between the new tags and the existing ones).\r\n\r\nIn terms of tagging existing articles, you will need to re-tag News/Blog articles if you want a tag driven navigation, although you probably only need to tag up enough recent articles to fill the navigation (the older articles will still appear under month/year). \r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts, as obviously it would be good to get this piece of work live.\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"attachments":[],"created_at":"2011/08/08 14:22:01 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Jamie,\n\nAre you free to take a call this afternoon.\n\nI think it would be good to chat about this properly as after a meeting last week it seems there are a few things to work through.\n\nThanks,\n\nTom\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":25108633},{"attachments":[],"created_at":"2011/11/14 12:25:19 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Reassigned to Jamie, as a reminder to discuss this with Tom this week.
