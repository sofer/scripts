I don't want to make a major fuss about it but I'm interested in seeing the history of the expired page and obviously don't want to unexpire it again. Can you investigate? Also, are you able to find out how many people went to the page when it was live yesterday (both times)?\n\nThanks\n\nDeb\n\nFrom: Jo Hemmant\nSent: 27 September 2011 09:46\nTo: Susannah Cooper\nCc: Ben Matthews; Claire Hutchinson\nSubject: FW: Globe to Globe press embargo\n\nHi Susannah\nCan you help with any of Nigel's questions please?\nMany thanks\nJo\n\nFrom: Nigel Hinds\nSent: 26 September 2011 20:24\nTo: Ben Matthews; Jo Hemmant\nCc: Claire Hutchinson; Paul Woodmansey\nSubject: Globe to Globe press embargo\n\nDear Ben and Jo\n\nI have a meeting with Dominic Dromgoole at 10am on Weds morning, and expect to get my ear heavily bent about our website having broken the press embargo.\n\nBy the end of tomorrow, please could you find out for me as much of the following as possible:\n\n *   When the link first went live?\n\n *   What time it came down the first time? *\n\n *   What time it went live the second time?\n\n *   What time it came down the second time? *\n\n *   How come it went live in the first place?\n\n *   What was the blip that made it go live the second time?\n\n *   Any data we have on the number of page visits (as close to 0 as possible, I hope)\n\n *   Any other info we have on the extent of the impact of the breach\n\n *   How can we stop it happening again?\n\n(*  I have a note of these through my emails, but it would be good to have them all on one note.)\n\n\n\nThanks, both.\n\n\n\nBest wishes\n\n\n\n    Nigel\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

This is usually very straight-forward but for news and blog pages it isn't, because the workflow is non-standard (see http://postcms.zendesk.com/entries/20480623-removing-news-and-blogs-from-the-site).\r\n\r\nWe were eventually able to put it back into a 'Draft' state, which meant that it wasn't being linked to from the front page, but to do this we had to bypass the usual workflows, so that the page was not actually deleted form the site.\r\n\r\nJamie has I think already looked at google analytics and it would appear that the page was accessed a few times in the late-afternoon. This is likely to have been when the page was inadvertently not just published on the site but linked to from other parts of the site.\r\n\r\nOnce we removed these links after around 6pm, the traffic appears to have died down from a handful of visits to nothing and even though the page was still on the site and theoretically visible, it was not being accessed, because there was no way to navigate to it from any other part of the site.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the tale is probably that if an embargoed news story (or blog entry) is mistakenly published and then expired, it is a mistake to attempt to recover it by bypassing the usual workflows. Instead, it is almost certainly easier to just create a new version of the page and re-enter the copy.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/28 08:53:30 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"thanks Danny.

The filename in the XML also doesn't take into account of the edge cases where the file is sent more than once (see below for details).

All others in the CMS have this ad tag.\n\nThat's the tag the page has already? (view the page source)\nvar tags='pgs_get-involved_volunteer/young-games-makers'\n\nI have mentioned this already to Erin, but probably worth re-iterating, the tags are *auto-generated* based on the section hierarchy in the CMS.\n\nWe have added in some special rules for keys sections ie. news/blogs/photos and the games/venue sections.\n\nBut there really is no notion of changing a tag on an individual page (we did do this for a BP/Arts page, but that was meant to be no more than a stop gap until we modified the CMS to allow you to assign/override the tag on a specific page). We can't continue to add 'per page' executions into the code base, we really need to keep it clean and limited to outputting tag from the standard logic or else we'll just end up with problems down the road.\n\nIn terms of tags that look wrong, if something looks wildly out then let us know (for example the year folder inside the photos sections meant that the standard logic for generating tags need to be slightly altered for those sections. But in general, the tags that are generated in the CMS should drive the DFP tags, rather than the other way round (as we don't have a config file where we can easily say these page or section get these tags).\n\nHope that makes sense\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/21 14:05:48 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Section is now republishing.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]}],"linkings":[],"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3686603},{"nice_id":5154,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/09/21 11:44:07 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"not_billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:40 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"0"}],"field_97116":"0","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:54 +0100","resolution_time":1,"priority_id":0,"current_tags":"authorized cms its level_0 none_required not_billable tested upload","assignee_id":3686603,"updated_at":"2011/10/20 09:35:41 +0100","req_name":"Uzma.Khan","ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2011/10/20 09:35:41 +0100","solved_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:40 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"not_billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/09/21 11:44:07 +0100","channel":null,"score":8,"via_id":4,"subject":"Publucation - error","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"permissions":{},"submitter_id":8189631,"base_score":8,"latest_recipients":"jamie@kitsite.com support+id1DFV-2DBS@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":"Jamie Unwin","problem_id":null,"status_id":4,"description":"PROTECT \n\n\nHi Guys \n\n \n\nI have been uploading some publications into the CMS but every time I\ntry to preview them I get the screen below - can you look into thanks.\nLet me know if I have upload them again. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUzma,\n\n \n\nUzma Khan\n\nMarketing Assistant (New Media)\n\nCommunications  \n\nDirect line: 020 3023 6927\n\n \n\nOlympic Delivery Authority\n\nMailpoint: 7a\n\n23rd Floor, One Churchill Place\n\nLondon E14 5LN\n\n \n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\n\nwww.london2012.com <http://www.london2012.com/> \n\n \n\nFind out what is going on at London 2012 HQ - http://blog.london2012.com\n<http://blog.london2012.com/> \n\n \n\n \n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email\n\n \n\n\nInformation owned by ODA\n\nPlease delete if you are not the intended recipient\n\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">This email and any attachments are for the attention of the addressee(s) only.\nIt may also be confidential.

My comments below:\n\nIntro text – there needs to be some fuller text here; will chase for this and forward asap.\n\nGeneral – on the spreadsheet with the data fields there is a column for ‘Associated text’ with some important information e.g. ‘Family name must be as it appears on your identification document’ etc. Is the best way to do this as tooltips using the ‘i’ icon we originally had for phase 1? These explanatory notes are important, as some of the fields they are asking for don’t make sense on their own\n\nSentence case for all field labels i.e. ‘Family name’ rather than ‘Family Name’ and ‘Preferred given name’ rather than ‘Preferred Given name’\n\nGender – the values requested by Ceremonies are ‘M=Male, F=Female’. I think therefore they want ‘M’ and ‘F’ rather than the full forms, and they want to remove the ‘Prefer not to say’ value from Phase 1. Is that a problem if you are pulling in data from Phase 1 and the applicant has only given ‘Prefer not to say’?\n\nIdentification type – apostrophe missing in ‘UK Driver’s Licence’\n\nID – I am pondering whether there is in fact an ID number on a birth certificate – surely not? I will check with Ceremonies whether this is in fact possible.\n\nCountry of issue for ID and Country of birth – dropdown isn’t wide enough for some of the values e.g. ‘United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ – do we need this full version of the UK (did Campbell mandate this country list?) or could we just have ‘United Kingdom’?\n\nConfirm email address field – this wasn’t on the original datasheet; also, won’t the email field be prepopulated from phase 1 (unless we are offering people the option to change the value?)\n\nBackground check – tweak question ‘Do you consent to background check?’ to ‘Do you consent to a background check?’\n\nDeclaration on Unspent Convictions – this doesn’t make sense grammatically or legally or whatever it’s supposed to do. I will check with Ceremonies team what it’s supposed to be....\n\n‘Do you have any accessibility requirements in order to undergo the audition process’ – missing a question mark\n\n‘If you answered yes to the above question, which of the above do you require?’ – please change to ‘If you answered yes to the above question, which of the above apply to you?’\n\n‘In the event of you being cast as a Ceremonies Volunteer Performer. Do you have any dietary requirements’ – please change to ‘In the event of you being cast as a Ceremonies Volunteer Performer, do you have any dietary requirements?’\n\n‘We are interested in whether you have any specific performance skills?’ – please change to ‘We are interested in whether you have any specific performance skills. Please check all which apply.’\n\nValues for skills – please make these sentence case e.g. ‘Circus skills’\n\nTypo in ‘Parrellel Skating’ – change to ‘Parallel skating’\n\nReminder on length of committement and compulsary dates – can we have the checkbox at the bottom of this statement rather than at the top?. Also two typos – should be ‘Reminder on length of commitment and compulsory dates’\n\nTerms and conditions – we need to link to these (open in a new window) at https://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/terms-and-conditions.php\n\n‘By submitting this form, and having read the FAQs [insert hyperlink to relevant FAQ]....’ - replace text in square brackets with link from ‘FAQs’ to https://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/faqs.php\n\nLink to Diversity and Inclusion Form<https://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/> – this needs to be removed from the actual sign-up form and should be displayed on the confirmation screen after the thank you message – it should link to the page http://survey.london2012.com/survey/386255/125c/ (I am still building this page, so ignore the resemblance to the Torch Relay D&I form)\n\nI tried to submit the form but got an error message ‘Sorry, there was an error processing your request. Please report this.’\n\nThank you message – change to ‘Thank you. Your details have been received and we will be in touch in the near future with confirmation of your audition details including date, time and venue.’\nWhen you say “The link, above, is for MY ceremonies signup, and I suggest you use it for testing as it allows you to return and re-edit your details EVEN IF you've already filled in and saved your details” – is this expected behaviour? I was expecting that the link would only work once – is it a security risk to allow people to access submitted data (if the link gets shared, for example)?\n\nI will chase Campbell re: his audition dates api – sorry you haven’t had it before now. Are you waiting for other things from him?\n\nPhew, that’s a lot. Happy to chat through these. Do you think by the end of the day most of these changes will be in place? Keen to share with the Ceremonies team so they can test.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nMorag\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/07 10:12:57 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Hi Morag, I'm working through these.

Intro text – there needs to be some fuller text here; will chase for this and forward asap.\r\nYou are able to edit this yourself:\r\n  https://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/pages/edit/games/ceremonies/get-involved/ceremonies-application-stage-two.php\r\n\r\n> 2. General – on the spreadsheet with the data fields there is a column for ‘Associated text’ with some important information e.g. ‘Family name must be as it appears on your identification document’ etc. Is the best way to do this as tooltips using the ‘i’ icon we originally had for phase 1? These explanatory notes are important, as some of the fields they are asking for don’t make sense on their own\r\nThe only piece of explanatory text that I see on the original is below the UK postcode box.\r\n https://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/ceremonies-application.php\r\nand I don't see any (i) icons. Did they get removed at some stage?\r\n\r\n> 3. Sentence case for all field labels i.e. ‘Family name’ rather than ‘Family Name’ and ‘Preferred given name’ rather than ‘Preferred Given name’\r\nAgree entirely - was (rather naively) following what was supplied!\r\n\r\n> 4. Gender – the values requested by Ceremonies are ‘M=Male, F=Female’. I think therefore they want ‘M’ and ‘F’ rather than the full forms, and they want to remove the ‘Prefer not to say’ value from Phase 1. Is that a problem if you are pulling in data from Phase 1 and the applicant has only given ‘Prefer not to say’?\r\nAre you saying that they want \"M\" to appear in the dropdown?\r\nI have made this change. However, I should flag it as being less usable than Male/Female. \r\n\r\n\r\n> 5. Identification type – apostrophe missing in ‘UK Driver’s Licence’\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> 6. ID – I am pondering whether there is in fact an ID number on a birth certificate – surely not? I will check with Ceremonies whether this is in fact possible.\r\nFurthermore, I doubt there is an expiry date on a (UK) Birth Cert, either!\r\n\r\n> 7. Country of issue for ID and Country of birth – dropdown isn’t wide enough for some of the values e.g. ‘United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ – do we need this full version of the UK (did Campbell mandate this country list?) or could we just have ‘United Kingdom’?\r\n\r\nI'm using the same list as is used for the YGM form.\r\nI agree that it is unusable (Lars struggled to find Germany under \"Federal Republic of Germany\" and if anyone from Uruguay manages to find \"Eastern Republic of Uruguay\" then I would surprised!). \r\nI am happy to work with whatever list is required, if Campbell can advise.\r\n\r\n> 8. Confirm email address field – this wasn’t on the original datasheet; also, won’t the email field be prepopulated from phase 1 (unless we are offering people the option to change the value?)\r\nOk. Removed (well, \"hidden\").\r\n\r\n> 9. Background check – tweak question ‘Do you consent to background check?’ to ‘Do you consent to a background check?’\r\n\r\n> 10. Declaration on Unspent Convictions – this doesn’t make sense grammatically or legally or whatever it’s supposed to do. I will check with Ceremonies team what it’s supposed to be....\r\nAgree! Thanks.\r\n\r\n> 11. ‘Do you have any accessibility requirements in order to undergo the audition process’ – missing a question mark\r\nDone\r\n\r\n> 12. ‘If you answered yes to the above question, which of the above do you require?’ – please change to ‘If you answered yes to the above question, which of the above apply to you?’\r\nDone, although I used my initiative and changed \"above\" to \"below\"!\r\n\r\n> 13. ‘In the event of you being cast as a Ceremonies Volunteer Performer. Do you have any dietary requirements’ – please change to ‘In the event of you being cast as a Ceremonies Volunteer Performer, do you have any dietary requirements?’\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> 14. ‘We are interested in whether you have any specific performance skills?’ – please change to ‘We are interested in whether you have any specific performance skills. Please check all which apply.’\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> 15. Values for skills – please make these sentence case e.g. ‘Circus skills’\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> 16. Typo in ‘Parrellel Skating’ – change to ‘Parallel skating’\r\nHmm, I even noticed that myself but forgot to fix!\r\n\r\n> 17. Reminder on length of committement and compulsary dates – can we have the checkbox at the bottom of this statement rather than at the top?. Also two typos – should be ‘Reminder on length of commitment and compulsory dates’\r\nAlignment is a little tricky. I will need to get Lars to look at this (but not right now as he's tied up with YGM form). \r\n\r\n> 18. Terms and conditions – we need to link to these (open in a new window) at https://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/terms-and-conditions.php\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> 19. ‘By submitting this form, and having read the FAQs [insert hyperlink to relevant FAQ]....’ - replace text in square brackets with link from ‘FAQs’ to https://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/faqs.php\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> 20. Link to Diversity and Inclusion Form<https://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/> – this needs to be removed from the actual sign-up form and should be displayed on the confirmation screen after the thank you message – it should link to the page http://survey.london2012.com/survey/386255/125c/ (I am still building this page, so ignore the resemblance to the Torch Relay D&I form)\r\nRemoved.\r\n\r\n            <div><a href=\"#\">Link to Diversity and Inclusion Form</a></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n> 21. I tried to submit the form but got an error message ‘Sorry, there was an error processing your request. Please report this.’\r\nThat is obviously not expected behaviour. Are you able to reproduce?\r\n\r\n> 22. Thank you message – change to ‘Thank you. Your details have been received and we will be in touch in the near future with confirmation of your audition details including date, time and venue.’\r\nJust so that I'm straight, you got an error the first time (21.) but no error the second time?\r\nAs per (1.) you are able to edit this text yourself, here:\r\n  https://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/pages/edit/games/ceremonies/get-involved/ceremonies-application-stage-two.php\r\n\r\n> 23. When you say “The link, above, is for MY ceremonies signup, and I suggest you use it for testing as it allows you to return and re-edit your details EVEN IF you've already filled in and saved your details” – is this expected behaviour? I was expecting that the link would only work once – is it a security risk to allow people to access submitted data (if the link gets shared, for example)?\r\nI mean that the link I supplied you is for kieran@kitsite.com. I have added some special-case processing so that kieran@kitsite.com IS allowed to return and edit his data (otherwise this testing that we're doing right now would be very cumbersome!)\r\n\r\n> 24. I will chase Campbell re: his audition dates api – sorry you haven’t had it before now. Are you waiting for other things from him?\r\nIt has been promised a number of times now. Most recently \"by yesterday evening\". I'm very keen to test against it ASAP, as there were differences even between the sample and the more detailed example.\r\n\r\n> Thank you so much!\r\nNot at all!\r\n\r\nKieran\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/07 11:34:56 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"ITEMS REQUIRING MY/YOUR INPUT\r\n\r\nC1.
