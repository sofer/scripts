No always just one and two, maybe just one sometime if the sport doesn’t want to add another question. also will the type always be a free text box? Yes\n- Other than the role specific question above, I can't see any fields that depend on the answers to previous fields, but can I just check this is correct? Yes – depending on role you select this determines which questions you get for 1 and/or two but this is the only dependent field.\n- Can we assume that the fields will be fixed / agreed and will not change post us starting work? or that if they are you are prepared for possibly significant additional costs / delays. If we are aware before speccing the work that text may change then we can look making this process more manageable, but obviously it will cost more to build that flexibility into the system. – no once we are live they will be fixed\n\nRegarding the backend, obviously the easier it is to use the better. My main requirement will be to be able to print off the applications to take to interview (so all the information is easy to read in the interview) and to do analysis to make sure an organisation hasn’t applied more than once for the same role, report on the number of roles they have applied for, look at the number of applications per role. Other solutions we are evaluating are cheap but have quite basic backend functionality e.g. using adobe forms. It would be great if you could cost with a csv backend but also something a bit more sophisticated with tabs.\nDo you know how long it will take you to get a view on costs, I am really keen to make a decision by the end of the week as I know we are running short of time.\n\nIf it is easier to chat about any of these requirements please do not hesitate to call me on 02032012656.\n\nThanks\nJess\n\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/07/06 10:26:03 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Speak to you post 5\n\nEnjoy the training :)\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/07/13 12:20:08 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Hi Morag,\r\n\r\nJust wanted to pick this back up, I know we had 90% of a conversation on it but kind of forgot if I was waiting on any info back from yourself or Jess or if you we're waiting on me.\r\n\r\nShould I go ahead and create a proposal based on your requirements and our understanding of how we would implement them, with that level of time/budget?

Ceremonies; in that if from the outset we had knew the form was going to get more complex, much like Ceremonies, we may have suggested a different route / approach; indeed as we have only just started on this piece of work that is still an option; I will discuss internally). \n\nMuch as I don't like to turn work down. I do wonder if (we can't go down the Rails route) it is better to just say no now in order to stem any further feature creep on a piece of work that is already fairly tight on timescale and already a large single page form. The biggest danger / risk / problem with all these data capture projects is flux or creep around the fields that need to be captured (inevitable to some extent, as more people are aware of the project and want the form to capture data pertinent to them, but equally a risk in terms of regression and errors creeping in / deadlines being missed).\n\nThat said we haven't gone so far that it would be a massive disruption to add the extra fields at this stage, although I would question whether you can have a form this long on one page without a 'save' option and therefore it may be worth quickly deciding if we would be better off re-scoping the project as a Rails app with a 4 stage / page form, that can be saved at any stage (although lack of lead time - to allow BTS to agree to us using a hosted Rails server - rather than development time is probably the biggest hurdle in a late change in architecture/approach; )\n\nCan I also check the client is OK with this just living on a standard Games maker template, we haven't costed for any kind of complex design work above the standard form layout and page look and feel. We were thinking along the lines of the accessible volunteer form.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/03 12:38:30 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Thanks, Jamie.\n\nMy feeling is that we say ‘no’ to any form amplification, for the reasons of a) time b) added complexity to the form c) the requirement to have to save the form (which I think would be key, given there are two people involved here).\n\nPage design – I think the basic GM form is fine. If we did something more designed we would use a separate budget and could use a separate designer for page layout, but I think the issue is time. I’m assuming there isn’t time to get a third party to do any html production (when would you need it for)?\n\nMorag\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/12 17:35:52 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Due: september 22.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/12 17:58:47 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"See attached.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[{"size":253619,"created_at":"2011/08/12 17:58:25 +0100","content_type":"application/pdf","token":"3eblviv1opflvxs","id":59843322,"filename":"LOCOG_-_Young_Games_Maker_application_v2.pdf","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/3eblviv1opflvxs/?name=LOCOG_-_Young_Games_Maker_application_v2.pdf"}]},{"created_at":"2011/08/15 16:30:30 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Meeting on Tuesday at 9am to review the above, mock ups and a couple of minor changes around data drop downs.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":51647622,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/15 16:42:58 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Wording for the application form introduction (main landing page) :\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for choosing to apply to the Young Games Maker programme.

However, the \"apostrophe fix\" appears (given the issue you raised) not to work in \"SharePoint\".\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I don't have any experience of SharePoint, but I would suggest that it might be an idea to do something approximating:\r\n\r\n 1. Select the entire column containing the telephone numbers.\r\n 2. Find the menu item, or control button that that allows you to specify the \"display format\" (possibly known as \"field format\").\r\n 3. Select a display format of \"text\", or \"unformatted\", or \"raw text\" / other. Basically you're looking for a format that ISN'T a number type.\r\n\r\nThe problem incidentally is that spreadsheet software treats fields as numbers by default. This means that the following issues arise when displaying fields containing telephone numbers:\r\n 1. Leading \"0\"s are omitted (as they're redundant when displaying numbers).\r\n 2. When the field reaches a certain length (i.e. over about 10 digits) numbers get displayed in scientific notation (e.g. 2.5234+E11).\r\nYou don't want either of these behaviours for telephone numbers, so you need to tell SharePojnt that these fields are NOT numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please ask, but bear in mind that I don't have a copy of SharePoint so I can't answer SharePoint-related questions with any authority!\r\n\r\nI hope this helps,\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nKieran","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/11/09 12:29:29 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Thanks Kieran\n\nI have adapted your process for Windows based Excel asked the HR team to see if that works for them.\n\nI have added to export changes to Current section of Pivotal.

It may also be that Stamen failed to call the CMS to retrieve the page correctly (or that by the time they had the page had moved or been renamed). We only keep basic logs so this stuff is hard to debug retrospectively.\n\nI am not entirely sure if Stamen limit the types of pages / the fields on the pages they receive at their end, or treat Events differently, although at the least I think they pick up the title for a page (if it's on the list of page types they except).\n\nThe first thing to test is that Stamen are getting sent pages. You can perform a simple test here, this is the url we use to poll Stamen about an page, if you add on the path to an Event after the path= then it should appear on the map \n\nThe URL to call to tell Stamen about a page--->\nhttp://data.map.london2012.com/kitsite-updates.php?path=events/competing-scarecrows.php\n\nThis causes Stamen to make a call back to our server for the XML for the page -->\nhttp://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/api/events/competing-scarecrows.php?apiKey=f7AafqNZDa2Vt6NmS.Py3Q\n\nAlthough not sure the second call back to us happens instantaneously, so if the page has been moved or renamed in the interim the call would fail.\n\nStill investigating, but a couple of questions;\n\n1) Do you have some concrete urls (not saying you making this up, but it's always easier if we are both looking at the same urls / pages).\n2) Can I check this is the generic main Stamen map and not a special Events view within the main map?\n3) When you say sporadic, is it really sporadic or do you think it's more that no new events are appearing and it's just new stories about events that are appearing? \n\nI have a recollection (and an in/out box with 200+ emails to/from Stamen whichI am reading though) that we did at one point do something specific re. Events, specifically round dates / type. Although looking at our code we call Stamen in exactly the same way regardless of what kind of page it is. However it is very possible, even likely (esp. if events are treated slightly differently) that Stamen are looking / checking for the existence of a field on an event that no longer exists and are therefore rejecting it.\n\nWho's your most up to date technical contact at Stamen?\n\nIt may be worth checking if Stamen handle Events in a special way / checking for special fields? \n\nFor example they should have been sent this event http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/api/events/competing-scarecrows.php?apiKey=f7AafqNZDa2Vt6NmS.Py3Q so may be worth checking if they would be rejecting it for any reason (assuming it hasn't made it to the map!)\n\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/06/24 15:01:47 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Following conversations today – probably best to put this on hold until next week at the earliest.\n\nHope thats ok,\n\nApologies!\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":25108633,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/11/08 15:43:24 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Closing old tickets","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]}],"linkings":[],"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":25108633},{"nice_id":3574,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/04/15 12:44:37 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"6","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:11 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:11 +0100","ticket_id":61725797,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/06/20 13:54:50 +0100","updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/24 13:55:23 +0100","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"6"},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/24 13:55:23 +0100","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"bill_to_oda"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/06/20 13:54:50 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/20 13:54:50 +0100","ticket_id":61725797,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/06/20 13:54:50 +0100","updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/07/05 15:48:12 +0100","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/07/13 12:20:46 +0100","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"0"}],"field_97116":"0","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:11 +0100","resolution_time":4972,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"6 authorized bill_to_oda chunky its level_0 none_required tested","assignee_id":3686603,"updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","req_name":"Uzma.Khan","ticket_type_id":4,"status_updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","solved_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"bill_to_oda","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/04/15 12:44:37 +0100","channel":null,"score":30,"via_id":4,"subject":"Learning Legacy updates","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"permissions":{},"submitter_id":8189631,"base_score":30,"latest_recipients":"support+id3574@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":"2011/07/15 12:00:00 +0100","current_collaborators":"Indy Rihal","problem_id":null,"status_id":3,"description":"Hi Jamie \n\n \n\nJust wanted to check that you got my email about Learning Legacy, as I\nhaven't heard anything back. \n\n \n\nRegards\n\nUzma.\n\n \n\nUzma Khan\n\nMarketing Assistant  \n\nCommunications  \n\nDirect line: 020 3023 6927\n\n \n\nOlympic Delivery Authority\n\nMailpoint: 7a\n\n23rd Floor, One Churchill Place\n\nLondon E14 5LN\n\n \n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\n\nwww.london2012.com http://www.london2012.com/ \n\n \n\nFind out what is going on at London 2012 HQ - http://blog.london2012.com\nhttp://blog.london2012.com/ \n\n \n\n*\n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email\n\n \n\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">This email and any attachments are for the attention of the addressee(s) only.\nIt may also be confidential.
