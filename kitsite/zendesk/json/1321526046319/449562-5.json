Occasionally, of course, mistakes happen.\r\nTo ensure such mistakes don't cause broken css to appear on the live site, we should add a workflow trigger that runs whenever you click \"publish\" on a css asset.\r\nThis trigger should validate the css against the live w3c validator:\r\n http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/api.html\r\nusing SOAP.\r\nIf any errors are found, an error should be raised, and the asset should NOT be published.\r\nOn the rare occasions when the validator is down, or if you really really want to publish some syntactically incorrect css, then you can manually amend the workflow, temporarily disabling the check.\r\nEstimate: 1 days work.\r\n\r\nPHP. It is similarly possible to mistakenly write template/container code which generates syntactically incorrect php code. We should amend the publication engine such that it runs \"php -l\" against each php file that it uploads, and refuses to upload any malformed php.

(just read your final line) \"Can we make the splash the entry point through the global nav, but not have it in the left hand nav when you are in the section? \"\n\nThis is *really* tricky as that navigation is completely encapsulated/logic based, will really have to have a hard think about how to do this / what is involved and do some experimenting on dev, it's not going to be simple and changing that nav will need proper testing as it effects the whole site.\n\nAlso \"and can we make the hub page the main 'II home' in the left hand nav?\"\n\nThat may be the simpler solution? Keep the navigation as it is (ie. splash page is not the index, it's just splash.php) and then just link direct to the splash page internally (when you want to) and/or setup a short url that takes users direct to the splash page if you send links in a mail out. \n\nMessing with that left hand nav in haste is probably not a great idea, it may be that (medium term) we could code a more generic solution that dealt with this situation, ie. allowed a Splash page to be used as to level page in a section. But as I said this will need some though. Another solution is we do something clever with cookies so that the user gets automatically redirected form the splash to the hub one they have seen that page (probably my preferred solution as it's more isolated than changing the local nav component).\n\nIf it helps you make a decision we won't be able to recode that left hand nav or do anything with cookies this week, \n\nSo it will either have to stay as it it is (ie. the top level link always goes to the splash) or we keep it as it was previously and just link internally (from promos, text) to the splash page and direct people external users to it via a short url\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/01/27 16:34:12 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Thanks for this, Jamie.\nI agree with your second solution: “Keep the navigation as it is (ie. splash page is not the index, it's just splash.php) and then just link direct to the splash page internally (when you want to) and/or setup a short url that takes users direct to the splash page if you send links in a mail out.”\n\nAre you able to make this change and let me know when I can publish it out?\n\nMany thanks!\n\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/01/27 16:35:50 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"PS Don’t suppose we could make the left-hand nav in Get involved > Education go to the International Inspiration section?\n\ni.e. the link highlighted in the grab below takes you via the splash page?

The important think to realise is that each page doesn't have it's own navigation HTML; there is no International Inspiration local nav (as an individual component) it's just some global logic that builds the nav depending on rules (news and blogs do have their own nav; but these are totally different and date based). I'm slightly loath to go down this route as there is a real danger of it leading to add behaviour which we spend days after the change tidying up.\n\n* I think you are thinking of cookie vs IP based \"sessions\" which is something a bit different, because you can only fit so much info in a cookie (~128 characters) the web-server stores some information on the server [ie. login name etc] gives that store of information (the session) an ID and then stores that 'session ID' in a cookie on the user browser so that on subsequent pages it can get the session id and then find any info stored for that ID locally on the server. The problem is because we have 6 server and no central session storage, we need to make sure that the user always goes back to the same server or else the information in the 'session' (stored on the server) won't exist. We used to do this based on IP ie. all users from a given IP address always got returned to the same server but post Akamai we had to do this with cookies (as all request appear to the load balancer to come from Akamaki; not sure that is entirely true, but that was the reason I was given). btw. this is that problem of why sometimes it appears as if you are logged out when you are logged in when using https (basically you get sent randomly to different servers each time and because you don't have a 'session' on that server it thinks you are logged out)","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/01/27 17:57:04 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Great – let’s go with the cookie then and see how we get on!

We also have the problem that the image isn't currently replaced / suppressed, only the main page that shows the image and possible links to that page.\n\nThe ideal solution would probably be a mix of suppression (when a checkbox is checked, we won't return this webcam to hub pages and/or components) but also to replace the image itself (and all the various repurposing / thumbnails of the image) with a holding image, the tricky thing is here is to stop the feed overwriting the 'holding image' when it next runs.\n\nIn short, the above is not something we can get in place this afternoon although we can try and push forward the priority on this work.\n\nYou should however be able suppress the webcam (via the checkbox on the page) and then republish the page, the homepage and hub pages, I think if you do that the webcam will be removed from the hub and homepage.\n\nJamie\n\nOn 9 Sep 2011, at 13:39, Tom Price-Stephens wrote:\n\n> Hi Jamie,\n>  \n> Following up from speaking to Danny,\n>  \n> There is a chance the webcams will be taken offline today for a number of days (something to do with scaffolding).\n>  \n> Apparently we have a holding page we can put in the webcam player – something along the lines of “webcam currently unavailable”\n>  \n> But we also would like to take the webcam option from the homepage?

I have provided a review below for everyone and new action points.\r\n \r\n-          Manual vs Dynamic tag generation\r\n\r\no   This still needs to be discussed with Kitsite, but the view at this stage is that dynamic tag generation is going to be the preference due to the following reason:\r\n\r\n§  Easier to implement\r\n\r\n§  There will be a communication process requirement via developers – trafficker, in either situation so it makes sense that if in the short time frames that we have to implement this that we go with this process.\r\n\r\n-          Iframe vs Javascript\r\n\r\no   Based on conversations with D3, we are going to be use iframes to upload our adverts. The reason being that the ad loading will not impact the page load.\r\n\r\n-          Allowing 3rd Party ad Tags\r\n\r\no   We still need to discuss this point with the Partners to understand how important a factor this is. We will focus on this point after we have got the ad serving up and running.\r\n\r\nActions ( in addition to the ones below):\r\n-          Morag to arrange meeting/ call with Kitsite to run through tagging preference and timelines for implementation\r\n\r\n-          Erin to set up users in DFP\r\n\r\n-          Erin to produce a javascrpt and iframe tag with a test creative for testing by Kitsite and Technology. Erin will send this to Morag by the EOP on Friday\r\n\r\n-          Colin/ Aaron/Technology to let us know testing timeline, ideally we will have all the tags implemented by 19th August. Testing could be scheduled w/c 22nd so that we are ready to go live on 1st September\r\n\r\nAny questions please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nErin\r\n \r\n \r\nKind Regards\r\n \r\nErin Berger\r\nTelephone:  +44 (0) 203 2012 061\r\nMobile:  +44 (0) 791 2999557\r\n \r\n \r\nFrom: Erin Berger \r\nSent: 09 August 2011 14:07\r\nTo: Morag Reavley; Liz Goulding; Tom Price-Stephens; Colin Miller; Aaron Shone\r\nCc: Dipesh Morjaria; Erin Berger\r\nSubject: RE: Follow up from DoubleClick Training: Action Plan\r\n \r\nAll,\r\n\r\nThank you for your time today, it was very useful and I am glad we are all linked up now.\r\n \r\nI have listed below the following action points and assigned who is responsible for each one. We need to have everything in place so we can begin serving advertising on the current website by 1st September.\r\n \r\nActions Plan\r\n1.      EB to speak to DoubleClick to get clarification/ information on the below ahead of our meeting on Thursday.\r\n\r\na.      Outline the benefits of manual tag generation vs. dynamic\r\n\r\nb.      Send over Technical Specification document\r\n\r\nc.       If using either java script or an iframe what would appear on the site should there be an error. Is it a 404 message or a blank screen? I am imagining a tag is generated but there is no creative assigned to it. Could we assign a default in-house creative?\r\n\r\nd.      Regarding 3rd Party ad tags: From the DoubleClick preferred list of 3rd Party providers, how has DoubleClick selected this list? Have you asked for confirmation that they take certain security process on their platforms to ensure that security issues are minimised?\r\n\r\n2.      MR to ask Kitsite if it is ok to point LOCOG CDN at Kitsite demo-site\r\n\r\n3.      Once MR receives Technical Specification Document from EB, speak to Kitsite to discuss tagging implementation preference\r\n\r\n4.      LG to raise point 2 with D3 tomorrow\r\n\r\n5.      EB to generate test code by Friday 12th August for Kitsite to begin testing. EB will send code to MR\r\n\r\n6.      w/c 15th August Tag generation Kitsite and EB\r\n\r\n7.      w/c 22nd August test the platform for:\r\n\r\na.      Tagging implementation- EB/DM/ Kitsite\r\n\r\nb.      Trafficking set up – EB/ DM\r\n\r\nc.       Security concerns- Technology Team\r\n\r\nd.      Load issues- Technology Team\r\n\r\n8.      Tuesday 30th August- EB to traffic really inventory into  platform\r\n\r\n9.      Wednesday 31st August final testing\r\n\r\n10.  Thursday 1st September – live adverts on site\r\n\r\nIf I have missed anything please feel free to let me know.\r\n \r\nMany thanks\r\nErin\r\n \r\nKind Regards\r\n \r\nErin Berger\r\nTelephone:  +44 (0) 203 2012 061\r\nMobile:  +44 (0) 791 2999557\r\n \r\n \r\nFrom: Erin Berger \r\nSent: 08 August 2011 10:30\r\nTo: Morag Reavley; Liz Goulding; Tom Price-Stephens\r\nCc: Dipesh Morjaria\r\nSubject: Follow up from DoubleClick Training\r\n \r\nGood Morning everyone,\r\n \r\nThanks for your time on Friday, I thought it was a really productive session and I am really looking forward to us being able to play around with the platform later this week.  \r\n \r\nMorag, I have asked Kudah to send over any technical documentation that he can today. Also we are going to be doing a follow up session on Thursday 11th, I am not too sure where as yet but I recall the afternoon was best. Kudah said he could spend some extra time with you Morag if you feel it is necessary.\r\n \r\nI feel that there a some key points raised on Friday that we need to address urgently amongst ourselves and also with technology. I have listed them below.\r\nTagging\r\n-          Now that we have seen what is involved in generating the tags across two levels, we need to really review the sitemap and determine who we approach the tagging.\r\n\r\nW    Questions to consider:\r\n\r\n·         Do we do it dynamically or manually\r\n\r\n·         Pro for dynamically- a lot simpler to implement.\r\n\r\n·         Con more risk- if the sitemap changes then there needs to be a new tag generated. More communication required between developers and trafficker.\r\n\r\n-         3rd party Tags\r\n\r\n        There may be a requirement to allow 3rd Part tags; they allow Partners the flexibility to change creative on their side without going through LOCOG. All creative would have to be pre-approved. I do appreciate however that there may be some concerns around security from technology around this offering. We need to gather a list of approved 3rd Party tag suppliers from Kudah and then discuss this with Technology.\r\n\r\n \r\niFrames\r\n        We discussed using iFrames for the ad slots. The feedback from DoubleClick was that, as we are not offering any expandable ad slots then it would be recommended to use iframes as they do not impact the loading of the page as the ad loads separately in the iframe. Is everyone in agreement that we use iframes?  From a implementation point of view it seems straight forward that you just select iFrame when we generate the tags.\r\n\r\nI will put some time in everyone’s calendar to review this ahead of our catch up with Kudah on Thursday.  I would really like to have someone from Technology there to have their input, is there a contact I could invite?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nErin\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nErin Berger\r\n \r\nDigital Media Project Manager\r\nTelephone:  +44 (0) 203 2012 061\r\nMobile:  +44 (0) 791 2999557\r\n \r\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\r\nOne Churchill Place\r\nCanary Wharf\r\nLondon E14 5LN\r\nlondon2012.com\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[{"size":369,"created_at":"2011/08/16 13:21:14 +0100","content_type":"text/plain","token":"ykrrpw2g94snfu4","id":60320197,"filename":"tags","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/ykrrpw2g94snfu4/?name=tags"}]},{"created_at":"2011/08/16 14:45:39 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Did you get the code okay?\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/16 15:12:30 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Yep, got it fine..","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/16 18:24:44 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Please find attached a sitemap showing how we propose to breakdown the site.\n\nBasically we’ll aim to drill down to level 2 and 3 functionality in terms of sub-section granularity.\n\nWill you just pull through the exact section paths into the pages?

Are you able to put together a timeline based around this date?\n\nMany thanks!\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462,"attachments":[{"size":28531,"created_at":"2011/08/16 18:24:44 +0100","content_type":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","token":"0tik9akxumxraui","id":60370792,"filename":"London_2012_sitemap_-_10_August_2012.xlsx","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/0tik9akxumxraui/?name=London_2012_sitemap_-_10_August_2012.xlsx"}]},{"created_at":"2011/08/17 09:29:20 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Hi Morag, can you attach the tags from your previous email to this ticket?\r\n\r\nI rather stupidly uploaded a file from my destop called tags, which was something completely unrelated !","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/17 09:36:34 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Done!\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462,"attachments":[{"size":5443,"created_at":"2011/08/17 09:36:34 +0100","content_type":"text/plain","token":"skynhoxcv4sngro","id":60493352,"filename":"Test_Javascript_and_iframe_tags_120811_v3.txt","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/skynhoxcv4sngro/?name=Test_Javascript_and_iframe_tags_120811_v3.txt"}]},{"created_at":"2011/08/17 09:41:45 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Morag, appologies just realised this tag approach isn't going to work, we cant generate specific tags per section like this (at least not in the timescales mentioned, we'll be pushed to get even the most basic tags in place and tested is month).\r\n\r\nIs there anyway to use a tag/parameter that simply takes a path parameter ie /foo/bar/filename.php ?","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/17 10:30:11 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Read my last comment as well, but..\n\nIf it helps we can pull out the 1st, 2nd or third level section names, although given that some key sections are already 2 levels deep not all level 3 sections have equal weight.\n\n/lowercase_section_name/sub_section_name would be the easier to pass in as we already have that info to hand, we Lao know if a page is an index or hub page.\n\nWe can also pass in any tags that are already on the page, but bear in mind that we can't easily do cascading of tags and so each page would need to be tagged.

I think you jsut need to republish the old and new list view pages.\n\nJust republished them so may take 15 min to appear.\nhttp://www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/supplier-pages/manufacture-supply-and-install.php\nhttp://www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/supplier-pages/engineering-and-maintenance.php\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]}],"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","updated_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","ticket_id":107275691,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/09/08 12:04:03 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:04:03 +0100","ticket_id":107275691,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","updated_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","ticket_id":107275691,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","updated_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","ticket_id":107275691,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:04:26 +0100","ticket_id":107275691,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/09/08 12:04:03 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:04:03 +0100","ticket_id":107275691,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/09/08 12:04:03 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:04:03 +0100","ticket_id":107275691,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:04:26 +0100","ticket_id":107275691,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:04:03 +0100","ticket_id":107275691,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:04:26 +0100","ticket_id":107275691,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","updated_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","ticket_id":107275691,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","updated_at":"2011/08/26 12:54:09 +0100","ticket_id":107275691,"value":"0"}],"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":8189631},{"permissions":{},"nice_id":4570,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/07/14 18:44:22 +0100","field_358835":"1","field_110059":"","field_97116":"1","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/07/14 18:44:22 +0100","resolution_time":1337,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"authorized billable level_0 none_required tested this_week","assignee_id":3686603,"channel":null,"updated_at":"2011/10/07 09:46:23 +0100","req_name":"Andy Watkins","ticket_type_id":4,"status_updated_at":"2011/10/07 09:46:23 +0100","solved_at":"2011/09/08 12:03:08 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/07/14 18:44:22 +0100","score":30,"via_id":0,"subject":"Generation of Video XML Google sitemap","recipient":null,"organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"problem_id":null,"submitter_id":3686603,"base_score":30,"latest_recipients":null,"due_date":"2011/07/29 12:00:00 +0100","current_collaborators":null,"linkings":[],"status_id":4,"description":"Create a Google Video sitemap","organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"2","assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","comments":[{"created_at":"2011/07/14 18:44:22 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Create a Google Video sitemap","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/07/19 18:00:21 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Hi Andy,\r\n\r\nWe've made some good progress on the video site map (only showing the first 20)\r\nhttps://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/preview/sitemap-videos.php\r\n\r\n**Unfortunately before we can go live** we need to supply a path the the video stream itself (rather than just the page) and currently we only have a path to a config file http://players.mediafreedom.twofourdigital.net/locog/script/config.js?id=7aad6ef2-7b8a-4005-b0a2-9f1d00cd57b3\r\n\r\nI'm going to fire an email over to eDialog to see if they can easily supply us with a url / string we can pass to Google (ie. a url we can tack that programme ID onto to get a direct url to the stream) and will cc you in. But you may need to chase up if I don't hear back from them as obviously I have no authority to ask them to do work (although I can't see why this would require any work other than a email response).\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\nSee here if you interested in the details\r\nhttp://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=80472\r\n\r\nThe values we need are as follows:\r\n\r\n1) <video:content_loc>\r\nYou must specify at least one of <video:player_loc> or <video:content_loc>. The URL should point to a .mpg, .mpeg, .mp4, .m4v, .mov, .wmv, .asf, .avi, .ra, .ram, .rm, .flv, or other video file format, and can be omitted if <video:player_loc> is specified. However, because Google needs to be able to check that the Flash object is actually a player for video (as opposed to some other use of Flash, e.g. games and animations), it's helpful to provide both.\r\n\r\n2) <video:player_loc>\r\nAt least one of <video:player_loc> or <video:content_loc> is required. A URL pointing to a Flash player for a specific video. In general, this is the information in the src element of an <embed> tag and should not be the same as the content of the <loc> tag. Since each video is uniquely identified by its content URL (the location of the actual video file) or, if a content URL is not present, a player URL (a URL pointing to a player for the video), you must include either the <video:player_loc> or <video:content_loc> tags. If these tags are omitted and we can't find this information, we'll be unable to index your video.\r\nThe optional attribute allow_embed specifies whether Google can embed the video in search results. Allowed values are Yes or No.\r\nThe optional attribute autoplay has a user-defined string (in the example above, ap=1) that Google may append (if appropriate) to the flashvars parameter to enable autoplay of the video. For example: <embed src=\"http://www.example.com/videoplayer.swf?video=123\" autoplay=\"ap=1\"/>.\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/07/25 15:40:27 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Hi Andy,\r\n\r\nHave spoken to TwoFour, here's an update:\r\n\r\nGood news is we can get at the src video attribute (ie. the one we need to supply to Google) via the *new* TwoFour API \r\n\r\nWe're currently migrating to the new API so I have asked Kieran to additionally pull this this parameter across as part of that work, we need to make an extra SOAP call to get this field and a few other changes, but it's nothing too onerous so we should be able to get those changes in place today.\r\n\r\nSo all we are waiting on now is the go ahead from Tom (Price Stephens) to switch over to the new API - I think Tom just wants to get 1 year to go out the way, before we swicth (in case anything goes wrong).\r\n\r\nBut as soon as we get the go ahead, we're ready to switch (to the new API) and in turn turn on the Video site map feed !\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]}],"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/07/18 11:08:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/07/18 11:08:00 +0100","ticket_id":90447857,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/07/14 18:44:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/07/19 19:10:53 +0100","ticket_id":90447857,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/07/18 11:08:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/07/18 11:08:00 +0100","ticket_id":90447857,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/07/18 11:08:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:03:08 +0100","ticket_id":90447857,"value":"billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/07/18 11:08:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:03:08 +0100","ticket_id":90447857,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/07/14 18:44:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:03:08 +0100","ticket_id":90447857,"value":"2"},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/07/14 18:44:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:03:08 +0100","ticket_id":90447857,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/07/18 11:08:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:03:08 +0100","ticket_id":90447857,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/07/14 18:44:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:03:08 +0100","ticket_id":90447857,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/07/18 11:08:00 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/08 12:03:08 +0100","ticket_id":90447857,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/07/14 18:44:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/07/14 18:44:22 +0100","ticket_id":90447857,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/07/14 18:44:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/07/18 11:08:00 +0100","ticket_id":90447857,"value":"1"}],"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":18087822},{"permissions":{},"nice_id":4983,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/08/25 09:51:07 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0.2","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/08/25 09:39:15 +0100","resolution_time":338,"priority_id":0,"current_tags":"authorized billable its level_0 none_required tested video","assignee_id":3686603,"channel":null,"updated_at":"2011/10/07 09:46:23 +0100","req_name":"Tom Price Stephens","ticket_type_id":4,"status_updated_at":"2011/10/07 09:46:23 +0100","solved_at":"2011/09/08 12:01:57 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/08/25 09:51:07 +0100","score":40,"via_id":4,"subject":"Paralympic Sports Pages","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"problem_id":null,"submitter_id":25108633,"base_score":40,"latest_recipients":"jamie@kitsite.com support+id31TP-Q85S@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":"2011/09/01 12:00:00 +0100","current_collaborators":null,"linkings":[],"status_id":4,"description":"Hi,\n\nWe need to embed videos onto the paralympic sports pages - in the same way as they are on the Olympic pages.\n\nHowever because it's paralympic sport we will be using twofour's video player.\n\nIs it possible to add a twofour embed tag into the metadata of the page?\n\nThis is short notice but high urgency, please give me a call so we can discuss getting this work done today/tomorrow.\n\nThanks\n\nTom Price-Stephens\nAssistant New Media Producer\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012  000 Extension: 381\nMobile: +44 7540 258 453\nwww.london2012.com\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.
