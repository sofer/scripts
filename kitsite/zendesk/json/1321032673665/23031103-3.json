Is 'Round the UK' really a tag, or just a grouping for articles that don't fit into any of the above categories?\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, tthe reason we are re-using the 'Theme' taxonomy is that, that is the taxonomy also used by other pages on the site including Photos, Videos etc. so if we want related images and videos to tie in with News and Blog pages it doent' make sense to have two taxonomies / tags (unless you want to also re-tag all the photos and videos)\r\n\r\nThe one danger / issue here is where we have News articles that are already tagged to the theme Taxonomy (as obv. we are not differentiating between the new tags and the existing ones).\r\n\r\nIn terms of tagging existing articles, you will need to re-tag News/Blog articles if you want a tag driven navigation, although you probably only need to tag up enough recent articles to fill the navigation (the older articles will still appear under month/year). \r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts, as obviously it would be good to get this piece of work live.\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/08 14:22:01 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Jamie,\n\nAre you free to take a call this afternoon.\n\nI think it would be good to chat about this properly as after a meeting last week it seems there are a few things to work through.\n\nThanks,\n\nTom\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":25108633,"attachments":[]}],"channel":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":28782245},{"nice_id":3821,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/04/28 12:17:37 +0100","field_110059":"","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:49 +0100","problem_id":null,"resolution_time":null,"priority_id":0,"current_tags":"its pages","assignee_id":3663591,"updated_at":"2011/04/28 12:17:37 +0100","req_name":"Kathryn Gilbert","linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2011/04/28 12:17:37 +0100","solved_at":null,"original_recipient_address":null,"field_147056":"","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/04/28 12:17:37 +0100","score":120,"via_id":4,"subject":"error message","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","group_id":61946,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","ticket_id":65978511,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/04/27 17:40:50 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/27 17:40:50 +0100","ticket_id":65978511,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","ticket_id":65978511,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","ticket_id":65978511,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","ticket_id":65978511,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/04/27 17:40:50 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/27 17:40:50 +0100","ticket_id":65978511,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/04/27 17:40:50 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/27 17:40:50 +0100","ticket_id":65978511,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","ticket_id":65978511,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","ticket_id":65978511,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","ticket_id":65978511,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","ticket_id":65978511,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/27 15:29:51 +0100","ticket_id":65978511,"value":"0"}],"submitter_id":12073254,"base_score":120,"permissions":{},"latest_recipients":"support+id3821@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"status_id":1,"description":"Hi,\n\nI just tried to rename this folder but am getting an error message.

(e.g. a request for www.london2012.com/Sports would redirect to www.london2012.com/sports) - before implementing this ensure that canonical URL can only be specified with lower case characters.\nSimple Apache rules exist to implement this logic.

The links contain the same addresses but won't display in IE6 for some reason.\n\n\nAll browsers had one rendering issue, on the 'team' pages there were underscores between the 'profile pictures' (fig.3)\n\nOther than these issues the pages are fine and I see no problem with them being pushed live.\n\nTom\n\n\nFig.1\n[cid:image002.jpg@01CBFB5F.C3D8A090]\n\n\nFig.2\n[cid:image003.jpg@01CBFB5F.C3D8A090]\n\n\nFig.3\n[cid:image004.jpg@01CBFB5F.C3D8A090]\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

This page could then be linked to as if it was a normal CMS page but when the link is rendered the url stored with the \"URL alias\" page would be used instead.\n\nYou could then construct a folder of these Aliases one for each Photo Galley and enter / store the appropriate long dynamic url [ http://www.london2012.com/p:hotos/search.php?q=Athletes%2BVillage&tag=&start=16&sort=&display=list&age=&related=&scores=&user= ] with each one. Then when you link to say 'Venue photos' the href that got output would be the path to the alias (or the short url of the Alias page once we have the SEO stuff done) at the server level we'd output a mod_rewrite rule to say, if you see a link to /venues-photos then do an internal redirect to display the contents of this long url.\n\nIf you think this is something that you'd be interested in let me know and I'll try and firm up the exact development required, but as a ballpark in the air expect it would be at least a weeks work.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/02/08 11:31:30 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"A quick update on this one: Jamie's suggestion of \"at least a weeks work\" is likely to be an understatement.

I guess we could trim the search query urls so that any null values are left out (although I'm not sure that will add much benefit, as we strip them out in the canonical paths on the pages anyway).\r\n\r\nnotes:\r\n\r\n- We can look at setting up some kind of 'Alias' feature, whereby the Alias' in turn could have short urls (fairly significant paid for work, which we do need to quote on, but would be good to know if they would consider 10-15 days work 'over the top' for this, before we type anything up / start work investigation what we'd actually need to do; which is work in itself).\r\n- We have already exclude many of these values from the search results pages, if you look the canonical url in the page it is much shorter.\r\n- Some of these values are required (unless we setup Alias') [I have listed them below for example we have a constitunecy-Doncaster is a 'real ' page)\r\n- Using Apache to handle Alias alone only solves the inbound link issue, the links in page will still have multiple parameters.","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/04/19 10:19:23 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Also marked as a priority for this week (realistically, probably next week now).

Obviously if these are inbound links from other sites (rather than just links in Googles site index) then that is another matter and we probably do need to match them up.\n\nThe one downside to bulk redirects like this is the server load, as every request will need to first run a check to see if it matches any of those redirects, this may seem insignificant at first, but if we ended up with a couple of thousand redirects that could in turn end up adding a significant load to each request especially which when multiplied up by millions of requests \n\nIf the URL follow a pattern ie. the section name has changed or if any pages in /volunteering should now go to the /volunteer hub we may be able to write a single wildcard redirect which would be more efficient.\n\nSo in short, yes we can, if it's external urls from other sites we should (and can we pattern match any of them en-mass?). But if this is just a case of cleaning up Google index it may be better to let Google's indexer go about it's business and drop the old urls and reindex the new ones next time it spiders the site, rather than trying to force anything and clogging up each request with hundreds of redirect lookups (which may grow over time).\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/02/04 16:45:31 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Andy, let us know if you want us to redirect these (and send us the file) or if you think it's OK to let them fall out of Google index and get re indexed naturally.\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/02/04 16:54:42 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Jamie,\n\nI’ve asked David to take a look at this.

Response from David on the 404 proposal is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have included an export of your Google crawl results and unfortunately we are talking about more like 10,000 URL than 300. This will have a significant impact on how this is approached. I think we need to identify wildcards that would forward with a 301 to some new or higher level directory. I am assuming that most of these 10,000 URL are the result of some old URL structure change where no appropriate 301s where put in place when the changes were rolled out. \r\n\r\nThe primary strategy is to redirect as many of these 404 to the appropriate pages using 301 redirects. The secondary strategy would be to have a smart 404 page for the 404 not caught by our rule set that uses search to provide relevant links to what the user is probably looking for. This smart 404 page is very much (OPTIONAL) and will not be necessary if we think we can catch most of the 404 with a rule set.\"\r\n\r\n(I've attached the list of 404s.)\r\n\r\nCould you take a look and tweak your proposal accordingly - hopefully you'll be able to spot a pattern in the 404 so that rules can be used for the redirects.\r\n\r\nI've not commented on the sitemap part of the document as we're handling that elsewhere now.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAndy","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":18087822,"attachments":[{"size":1710817,"created_at":"2011/07/14 17:18:15 +0100","content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","token":"laeghwbmmsavd1h","id":56124981,"filename":"Web_crawl_errors_www_london2012_com_20110704T032803Z.csv","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/laeghwbmmsavd1h/?name=Web_crawl_errors_www_london2012_com_20110704T032803Z.csv"}]},{"created_at":"2011/08/01 15:44:19 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Hi, realise you're flat out at the moment, but could you let me know when you'll be able to take a look at this?","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":18087822,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/30 11:18:27 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"I propose the following:\r\n  1. 403's should yield the error page.\r\n  2.
