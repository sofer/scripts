While we are happy to try and confirm to / use the same fields as ION is using (if ION get us the fields they are using internally in the few days then we can use those values as a basis when creating out our internal data model / form fields), we are not expecting (at least within the given costs) to build a feed exactly to ION's requirements (for example we will be exporting dates in YYYYMMDD format and will expect the ION system to import the date fields in the format, rather than us exporting dates in a custom format).\n\n b) We will simply be providing a 'export CSV' option in the backend CMS, you can manually export this file and email or FTP this file to ION as often as your like, but each export will contain all previous values, this should be an issue as ION can simply ignore any records they already have entered in tier system.\n\nWe can look at constructing a more tightly coupled integration with ION, but obviously there are additional costs here.\n\n4) Location / City / Town / Place of Birth / Organisation Status\n\nWe are assuming these are free text fields? \n\n5) Getting a copy of the final fields that ION will be using.\n\nIn fact given that these fields will eventually need to be imported by ION it probably makes sense for them to provide us with the database fields and allowed values they are using themselves. \n\nAlthough do be aware that:\n\n a) we will need these values to commence work \n b) any changes to these fields could have significant costs, on top of any CR cost from ION, we will also need to change the form, the data model, the CSV export and (depending on how far along we are) then retest everything.\n\n7) C.2.i \"Please provide the following details of your licence: \" \nDoes this need to be checkboxes or can it just be a drop down (ie. can a user have more than one checked?\n\n8) C.2.ii and B.5.i \"Issuing body (local authority or The Royal Parks):\nI assume the values here are taken form the C column of your spreadsheet? ie. \"Local Authority\" ?\n\n* please be aware that in terms of \"or other please specify.....................\" the other field will be a separate field in our data model and therefore our CSV export ie. we will have a field called \"issuing_body\" and a field named \"issuing_body_other\" which may not entirely match with ION's data model. Although on import it should be fairly simply form them to merge these fields if that is what they required.\n\n9) That \"PART D - DECLARATION\" is not require on the electronic versions, other than a checkbox next to a block of T&C text that is editable by yourselves.\n\nHappy to have a chat though any of this...\n\nI think the most important things in terms of getting the ball rolling are:\n\ni) agreeing on date/time and how that works.\nii) getting the field values that ION are expecting to use (*)\n\n(*) as I have said above we can't guarantee (within the given budget) that our CSV export will 100% match ION's data model or ideal CSV format, but we will (if we receive them this week) use them as a basis for constructing our data model meaning that only the smallest manipulation will need to be done by IOn when importing our CSV export. \n\nthanks\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]}],"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":66963456},{"nice_id":5755,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/11/30 12:04:03 +0000","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","channel":null,"field_97116":"0","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","resolution_time":30,"priority_id":0,"current_tags":"cms its level_0 none_required not_billable tested","assignee_id":3686603,"updated_at":"2011/12/30 10:00:46 +0000","req_name":"Jamie Unwin","score":24,"ticket_type_id":4,"status_updated_at":"2011/12/30 10:00:46 +0000","solved_at":"2011/12/01 17:54:08 +0000","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"not_billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/11/30 12:04:03 +0000","via_id":4,"subject":"Re: rdf file type?","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","organization_name":"Kitsite","group_id":61946,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","updated_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","ticket_id":144436372,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/12/01 17:54:08 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/01 17:54:08 +0000","ticket_id":144436372,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","updated_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","ticket_id":144436372,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/01 17:54:08 +0000","ticket_id":144436372,"value":"not_billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","updated_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","ticket_id":144436372,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/12/01 17:54:08 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/01 17:54:08 +0000","ticket_id":144436372,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/12/01 17:54:08 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/01 17:54:08 +0000","ticket_id":144436372,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/01 17:54:08 +0000","ticket_id":144436372,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/01 17:54:08 +0000","ticket_id":144436372,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/01 17:54:08 +0000","ticket_id":144436372,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","updated_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","ticket_id":144436372,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","updated_at":"2011/11/30 11:32:07 +0000","ticket_id":144436372,"value":"0"}],"linkings":[],"problem_id":null,"submitter_id":3686603,"base_score":24,"latest_recipients":"jamie@kitsite.com support+idHVRC-W4HN@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":"2011/12/08 12:00:00 +0000","current_collaborators":"Uzma.Khan, Lars Bortfeldt","permissions":{},"status_id":4,"description":"Hi Uzma,\n\nSorry I wasn't around yesterday afternoon, does this still need uploading and if so where do you want it uploaded?\n\nthanks\n\nJamie\n\nOn 29 Nov 2011, at 15:26, Uzma Khan wrote:\n\n> PROTECT\n>  \n> Sorry file attached.\n>  \n> From: Uzma Khan \n> Sent: 29 November 2011 15:25\n> To: 'Jamie Unwin'\n> Subject: rdf file type? \n> Importance: High\n>  \n> PROTECT\n>  \n> Hi Jamie\n>  \n> We have had an urgent request from out HR team to get a document on the website â itâs rdf file type.

(http://www.siteeyelive.com/monitor/london2012/camputer23.jpg) is associated with those views I can reinstate them.\n\nLet me know if any of this doesn't make sense !\n\nthanks\n\nJamie\n\nps. below
