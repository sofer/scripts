If you need more feedback on what the issues are, Jamie will be able to give you feedback. \r\n\r\nIt you do want us to investigate why particular events are not on the map, it would be helpful if you could give us some examples (although, warning: this may end up being time-consuming).","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/06/23 11:57:40 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"\"Long standing issue\" may not be the best wording ;-)\n\nIt may have just be that a call wasn't correctly made to Stamen's server from our end, we do try to resend automatically if this happens though so that is a bit odd. It may also be that Stamen failed to call the CMS to retrieve the page correctly (or that by the time they had the page had moved or been renamed). We only keep basic logs so this stuff is hard to debug retrospectively.\n\nI am not entirely sure if Stamen limit the types of pages / the fields on the pages they receive at their end, or treat Events differently, although at the least I think they pick up the title for a page (if it's on the list of page types they except).\n\nThe first thing to test is that Stamen are getting sent pages. You can perform a simple test here, this is the url we use to poll Stamen about an page, if you add on the path to an Event after the path= then it should appear on the map \n\nThe URL to call to tell Stamen about a page--->\nhttp://data.map.london2012.com/kitsite-updates.php?path=events/competing-scarecrows.php\n\nThis causes Stamen to make a call back to our server for the XML for the page -->\nhttp://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/api/events/competing-scarecrows.php?apiKey=f7AafqNZDa2Vt6NmS.Py3Q\n\nAlthough not sure the second call back to us happens instantaneously, so if the page has been moved or renamed in the interim the call would fail.\n\nStill investigating, but a couple of questions;\n\n1) Do you have some concrete urls (not saying you making this up, but it's always easier if we are both looking at the same urls / pages).\n2) Can I check this is the generic main Stamen map and not a special Events view within the main map?\n3) When you say sporadic, is it really sporadic or do you think it's more that no new events are appearing and it's just new stories about events that are appearing? \n\nI have a recollection (and an in/out box with 200+ emails to/from Stamen whichI am reading though) that we did at one point do something specific re. Events, specifically round dates / type. Although looking at our code we call Stamen in exactly the same way regardless of what kind of page it is. However it is very possible, even likely (esp. if events are treated slightly differently) that Stamen are looking / checking for the existence of a field on an event that no longer exists and are therefore rejecting it.\n\nWho's your most up to date technical contact at Stamen?\n\nIt may be worth checking if Stamen handle Events in a special way / checking for special fields? \n\nFor example they should have been sent this event http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/api/events/competing-scarecrows.php?apiKey=f7AafqNZDa2Vt6NmS.Py3Q so may be worth checking if they would be rejecting it for any reason (assuming it hasn't made it to the map!)\n\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/06/24 15:01:47 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Following conversations today – probably best to put this on hold until next week at the earliest.\n\nHope thats ok,\n\nApologies!\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":25108633,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/11/08 15:43:24 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Closing old tickets","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]}],"permissions":{},"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":25108633},{"nice_id":3574,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/04/15 12:44:37 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"6","field_97116":"0","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:11 +0100","resolution_time":4972,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"6 authorized bill_to_oda chunky its level_0 none_required tested","assignee_id":3686603,"channel":null,"updated_at":"2011/12/07 09:37:27 +0000","req_name":"Uzma.Khan","score":30,"ticket_type_id":4,"status_updated_at":"2011/12/07 09:37:27 +0000","solved_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"bill_to_oda","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/04/15 12:44:37 +0100","via_id":4,"subject":"Learning Legacy updates","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"submitter_id":8189631,"base_score":30,"latest_recipients":"support+id3574@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":"2011/07/15 12:00:00 +0100","current_collaborators":"Indy Rihal","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:11 +0100","updated_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:11 +0100","ticket_id":61725797,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/06/20 13:54:50 +0100","updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/24 13:55:23 +0100","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"6"},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/24 13:55:23 +0100","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"bill_to_oda"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/06/20 13:54:50 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/20 13:54:50 +0100","ticket_id":61725797,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/06/20 13:54:50 +0100","updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:42:54 +0000","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/07/05 15:48:12 +0100","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/04/15 12:40:12 +0100","updated_at":"2011/07/13 12:20:46 +0100","ticket_id":61725797,"value":"0"}],"linkings":[],"problem_id":null,"status_id":4,"description":"Hi Jamie \n\n \n\nJust wanted to check that you got my email about Learning Legacy, as I\nhaven't heard anything back. \n\n \n\nRegards\n\nUzma.\n\n \n\nUzma Khan\n\nMarketing Assistant  \n\nCommunications  \n\nDirect line: 020 3023 6927\n\n \n\nOlympic Delivery Authority\n\nMailpoint: 7a\n\n23rd Floor, One Churchill Place\n\nLondon E14 5LN\n\n \n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\n\nwww.london2012.com http://www.london2012.com/ \n\n \n\nFind out what is going on at London 2012 HQ - http://blog.london2012.com\nhttp://blog.london2012.com/ \n\n \n\n*\n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email\n\n \n\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">This email and any attachments are for the attention of the addressee(s) only.\nIt may also be confidential.

This is because when the URL www.london2012.com/PressOperationsExchange was created it enabled the page to be tracked and searched by Google.  This means that if anyone were to look up \"The Exchange London 2012\" on the search engine the would get the following results:\n\n[cid:image002.jpg@01CC9985.2A22DE10]\n\nWith both the top two link directing people to the Press Operations registration site, it would be fair to assume that this is how many users have been able to register, in error, for the site.\n\nAs well as being an annoyance for you, there is the danger that access to the log in site could present a security risk.  With various sites on the Exchange containing private and confidential materials, combined with the fact that the Exchange was never intended to be a public facing share point tool, the sites appearance on Google has caused some concern.\n\nOur understanding is that the URL was created by someone in New Media.

screen grabs, the lock/unlock is used to 'check out a page' manually.\n\nWhen your editing a page the page is also checked out automatically and checked back in when you save the page. \n\nIt's basically 'checked out' so that no one else can edit the page while you are editing it (only one person can update a single page at a time for obvious reasons)\n\nNot saying that someone manually did this, there are occasions when a page isn't automatically checked in (your browser crashing before you close the page can cause this).\n\nAlthough possibility is some other process checked the page out, for example the translation feed, locks or 'checks out' the page which it makes any automated updates to the page/\n\nJamie\n\n\n\nScreen shot 2011-10-07 at 11.26.59.png\nScreen shot 2011-10-07

We can remove the hspace=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" but need to check with Erin/Doubleclick/Google if this will cause issues.\n\n- Line 27, Column 251: there is no attribute \"hspace\"\n…ginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scroll…\n\nLine 32, Column 125: required attribute \"alt\" not specified\n…gs_settings;sz=728x90;tile=1;lang=en;ord=1316513423?' width='728' height='90'/>\n\n2b) Parsing errors - Google +1\n\nThis is because Google are using their own tag <g:plusone> into the page.\n\n[This is a very well known, documented and discussed issue, the problem / solution is not clear cut - with many arguing that what we are doing is correct and the parser / validator is wrong]\n\nLine 67, Column 172: there is no attribute \"size\"\n…/plusone.js\"><\/script><g:plusone size=\"medium\"></g:plusone></li><li id=\"so-fac…\n\nLine 67, Column 180: element \"g:plusone\" undefined\n….js\"><\/script><g:plusone size=\"medium\"></g:plusone></li><li id=\"so-facebook\"><…\n\nThis issue is documented here:\nhttp://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Webmasters/thread?tid=51eb2ff3e340bc76&hl=en\n\nThere are people suggesting using a <div> tag instead of the <g:plusone> but we'd need to investigate further if this will cause other issues, the code Tom supplied was in the <g:plusone> format and that is the format Google suggest is used.\n\n2c) Parsing errors - Facebook\n\nThis is a very similar issue to above, namely Facebook specific tags <fb:like/> which the W3C doesnt' like as is doesn't know about them.\n\n[Once again this is a very well known, documented and discussed issue, the problem / solution is not clear cut - with many arguing that what we are doing is correct and the parser / validator is wrong]\n\nLine 67, Column 379: there is no attribute \"href\"\n…4&amp;xfbml=1\"><\/script><fb:like href=\"https://www.facebook.com/London2012\" se…\n\nThe correct solution here, which we have previously implemented (although I think we took out in the ned) is to add a namespace attribute to the page so that the <fb:> and <g:> tags are not part of the document, but the W3C validator seems to ignore the namespace declaration. Kieran spent quite an amount of time investigating this a few weeks back when we added the Google +1 tags. It may be best if II let him explain direct (to you or whoever need to know).\n\n3) Non-text content [ref: 1.1.1] – LOCOG logo needs descriptive\n\nThe site says \"LOCOG logo\" across the site it always has, ironically I think we were previously told to use \"LOCOG logo\" as it was descriptive of the image (along the acronym LOOCG probably isn't that obvious).\n\nIf you want we could change it, but I don't think we should change it only in one place? hence we'll need to bulk republish the site, this is unrelated to the e-signup pages specifically.\n\nIs changing this a priority for launching eDialog?\n\n4) Focus visible [ref: 2.4.7] – Three Stylesheet links show no focus indicator\n\nThis is common to the whole site, I am not sure this has ever been an issue before / it was never in the designs. \n\nOnce again this is a moderately significant site wide change, unrelated to the e-signup pages specifically, I think we probably need to agree what this wil look like . check it cross browser first before rolling it out.\n\nIs changing this a priority for launching eDialog?","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/20 12:26:40 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"See http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/5012 \"the 2012 home page doesn't validate\" raised by Kieran a couple of weeks ago.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/23 11:34:17 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Danny,\r\n\r\nNeed to be careful with this ticket / what it contains, there is a multitude of tasks that may or not be getting tracked correctly, there may be other tickets that cover a sub set of these tasks.\r\n\r\n- The actual dev work work on the e-dialog page [7 days]\r\n- The in initial / additional conference calls / investigation / correspondence with LOCOG / e-dialog over the above [3 days, so far]\r\n- The modification of the login links (to signup) plus any redirects in preparation of the switch over [0.5 days]\r\n- The disabling of commenting and photo upload [0.5 days]\r\n- The deployment of any code / switch over [to do]\r\n- The rewriting of blog commenting / photo upload (these should be, and I think are separate tickets?)\r\n- Ability.net changes re. parse errors with Facebook, Google + and double click [so far 0.5 day, ongoing..]\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/10/06 12:01:48 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"New tickets opened: #4284 and #4285.

I am sure we coudl recode this and put the height/width or padding on a wrapper <div> but this is not the sort of whim we want to make on a whim as it could cause issues elsewhere on the site.\n\nWhy we are using a <h3> I am not sure, it's not something we would do, but I expect CogApp had a reason for doing so. As mentioned above we can look at recoding, but not without taking time to look at why it is coded like that and what are implications of recoding it. \n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/26 11:40:20 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Hey, soz if I was unclear, wasn’t suggesting you make them now :-) Fine to do it at your own pace if that can be sometime this week?\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3734551,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/26 11:46:47 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"I expect the first will be fairly easy to address, the second more tricky.\n\nAlthough the first seems like a major oversight (excuse the pun) / embarrassment, when advertising a blind sport even so will try and get that one looked at with the highest priority (ie. today).\n\nThe second, while not technically correct, I expect won't actually cause anyone serious issues in terms of navigating the site on a screen reader - although will look into that as well, but probably not till later on in the week.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/26 12:19:00 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Much appreciated\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3734551,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/27 14:06:17 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Hi Finn,\r\n\r\nI have updated the logo with alternative text (you can actually do this yourself by editing the relevant header component in <sport>/includes/header) [see attached screen shot 1]. \r\n\r\nhttps://londonprepares.kitsite.com/kit/pages/edit/goalball/includes/header.html\r\n\r\nI have only updated Goalball, will leave you to check/amend the others.\r\n\r\nIn terms of turning it from a <div> tag into a <h1> tags I did actually do this [see attached screen shot 2 and 3 for before and after]. \r\n\r\nBut....\r\n\r\n Then noticed this has a unwanted side effect on the news pages as they already have a <h1> tag, so we now have two [see attached screen shot 4]. \r\n\r\nWe can't just change the <h1> into a <h2> as we already have different styles applied to the <h2> additional we shouldn't have two <h1> tags as when Google see's two <h1> tags there is evidence that it discards both and just uses the page title.\r\n\r\nFurthermore because the header component is a shared include and  doesn't know about the page it is included in, we can't conditionally write out different tags depending on the page.\r\n\r\nI have therefore reverted the image header back into a <div>, although it now does now have the fallback text.\r\n\r\nAm yet to look at the footer.\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[{"size":87299,"created_at":"2011/09/27 13:54:17 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"aeveofzmmedabug","id":68903097,"filename":"edit-title.png","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/aeveofzmmedabug/?name=edit-title.png"},{"size":306070,"created_at":"2011/09/27 14:00:37 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"kqkxtkuexmnmkgy","id":68904457,"filename":"title-as-div.png","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/kqkxtkuexmnmkgy/?name=title-as-div.png"},{"size":255473,"created_at":"2011/09/27 14:00:50 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"par8nhx13c977xn","id":67077408,"filename":"title-as-h1.png","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/par8nhx13c977xn/?name=title-as-h1.png"},{"size":155707,"created_at":"2011/09/27 14:00:57 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"jprhhggltmmgixc","id":68904527,"filename":"two-h1-tags-on-news-page.png","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/jprhhggltmmgixc/?name=two-h1-tags-on-news-page.png"}]},{"created_at":"2011/09/27 14:13:38 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Cool, thanks Jamie.
