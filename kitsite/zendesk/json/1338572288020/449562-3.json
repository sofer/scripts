My findings as follows.\n\n\n\n1. Ballygalley and Malborough are misspelt communities in Roadrunner.\nNot sure how we’ve not spotted them before, but I’ve corrected in our\nmacro so the updated extract attached should have the correct values\nof Ballygally and Marlborough. Similarly, I’ve changed Nottingham (a)\nto just Nottingham.\n\n\n\n2. Denham and Shaldon are genuine communities but missing from the\nRegions mapping. Denham needs to be added to London, and Shaldon needs\nto be added to the South West.\n\n\n\n3. The others are all ‘moments’, which are generally short diversions\nto take in a famous place or landmark. In the rush to get the last\nrelease out we agreed these would not be accessible via the\nregion/communities search (they still appear in searches by name and\ndate), but we’ll need to address this on the GTW. We’ll either assign\nthem to the nearest actual community, using the macro, or include them\nin the communities list. I’ll confirm as soon as I can but I think the\nlatter option is probably the more palatable.\n\n\n\nKieran, could you apply the change in point 2 to the current TB search\npage, and process the updated extract attached?\n\n\n\nSteve, I’ve converted Kieran’s json file containing the communities to\nregions mapping into a spreadsheet, attached.

I had naively assumed that this problem was directly related to the technical issues that the 3rd party servers were experiencing at the end of last week. However it was slightly more complicated than that.\r\n\r\nFirstly, can you please use the \"News article\" template whenever you create news articles /anywhere/ on the website. I am not quite sure where the \"News article fr\" template came from but it should NOT be used. I am going to find out what it was used for and whether it can be deleted but ... until then (in fact, forever, going forward) can you use the \"News article\" template please?\r\n\r\nSecondly, there was an issue (which I've only just discovered) whereby manually-created pages in the French site were not being assigned a language of \"fr\", meaning that - even though they were in the French site - they were not appearing on the various French hubs. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\nIn short, if you create pages using the \"News article\" template, they should (now) get the correct language assigned to them and - when you publish them - they should appear on the site within a few minutes. I have not tested this all the way through (as I didn't want to place any test content on the live servers) but can you let me know (via this ticket) as soon as you try this, whether or not it works as expected.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nKieran\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2012/04/16 17:03:07 +0100","via_id":19,"value":"Ticket #9024 \"French website\" was closed and merged into this ticket.

We had all sorts of fun with the torch team updating these in the source system and breaking the TB search functionality, so in the end I created a macro to maintain the values the Kitsite team were expecting to receive.

We had all sorts of fun with the torch team updating these in the source system and breaking the TB search functionality, so in the end I created a macro to maintain the values the Kitsite team were expecting to receive.

We published another article last week with the same settings.\nUnfortunately, both articles seem to be hidden somewhere and they do not appear on the French News section of the website, right after another article, even if the url works separately. So it seems there is no url problem.\n\nWe noticed also that the only article that appears on the index page was not the same type, that is, “news article” and not “news article fr”. We tried to republish the last article with the “news article” type but it seems it is not the problem.\n\nYou might be right on the second idea you pointed out but how can we make it automatically and update the French index ?\n\nThank you very much\n\nMayra\n\n\n\nFrom: Anne de Faramond\nSent: 16 April 2012 14:53\nTo: Mayra Agudelo\nSubject: FW: [PostCMS support] Re: French website\n\n\n\nFrom: Jamie Unwin [mailto:notifications-support@postcms.zendesk.com]\nSent: 16 April 2012 14:44\nTo: Anne de Faramond\nSubject: [PostCMS support] Re: French websiteFrom: Jamie Unwin [mailto:notifications-support@postcms.zendesk.com]\r\nSent: 16 April 2012 14:44\r\nTo: Anne de Faramond\r\nSubject: [PostCMS support] Re: French website","score":0,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"","assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","channel":null,"problem_id":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":198463662},{"nice_id":9105,"initially_assigned_at":"2012/04/16 13:19:58 +0100","field_358835":"0.1","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0.1","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2012/04/16 12:53:42 +0100","resolution_time":0,"priority_id":0,"current_tags":"authorized billable its upload","assignee_id":3686603,"updated_at":"2012/05/15 09:58:14 +0100","req_name":"Tom Price Stephens","permissions":{},"ticket_type_id":4,"status_updated_at":"2012/05/15 09:58:14 +0100","solved_at":"2012/04/16 13:19:58 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2012/04/16 13:19:58 +0100","comments":[{"created_at":"2012/04/16 12:53:42 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Begin forwarded message:\n\n> From: Tom Price-Stephens <Tom.Price-Stephens@london2012.com>\n> Date: 13 April 2012 14:56:07 GMT+01:00\n> To: Jamie Unwin <jamie@kitsite.com>\n> Subject: jamiemaster100112.xlsx\n> \n> Apologies Jamie,\n>  \n> The spreadsheet I sent you earlier was wrong – could we please upload this one,\n> \n> Thanks,\n> \n> TOm\n> \n> \n> The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited \n> A company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819\n> This E-mail is confidential.
