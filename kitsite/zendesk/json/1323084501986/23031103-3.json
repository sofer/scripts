I am not entirely sure who last installed the www.london2102.com certificate and/or if we are allowed to install them [am trying to find Kieran to ask if he remembers].

The only thing that *really* need to be made secure is the transmission of data from the form to the CMS once it is posted off. \n\n## I know you have very strict data protection requirements, but I would personally question how personal this data actually is? Is someone really going to sniff a network to capture someone email address? I just did a straw poll, but most (large) site capturing this data don't do it over HTTPS ie. the weekly newsletter signup form on TimeOut http://www.timeout.com/london/ ##\n\nKieran's not in today, but he's in the London office next week, we'll do out best to get back to you on Monday/Tuesday with a more confirmed list of tasks and timescales, with a provisional schedule to carry out the work (assuming you want us to press ahead with it).\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/07/25 11:21:53 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Thanks, Jamie – very very helpful.\n\nWill relay to Technology and get them to make a call.\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/11 17:53:10 +0100","via_id":19,"value":"Ticket #4721 \"Festival Website\" was closed and merged into this ticket.\r\n\r\nLast comment in ticket #4721: This is a follow up to #4601.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/31 17:35:37 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Danny\n\nThis one will not go away I am afraid.\n\nCan we speak about how best to do this – understand Jamie’s concerns but our security folks have strict policies on the transmission of personal data.\n\nAs this is on Akamai can we not just put the whole thing on the Akamai secure network and use their wildcard *.london2012 certificate?\n\nRuss\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":14724144,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/31 18:19:42 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Russ,\n\nGiven you now host the wildcard *.london2012 certificate cert with Akamai then yes, as you suggest, we could just serve the entire site over https.\n\nGiven that the site is basically a one page AJAX / JS driven site that probably isn't such a crazy idea (we probably need to revisit for festival phase II though)\n\nSomeone (not sure who manages the conf files in stage03/04 and web01/06 now) would just need to add a Apache rule to rewrite all http request back to a https alternative.\n\nWe'd also need to make sure that all the urls in the pages that reference assets do so via https urls so we don't get any mixed content warnings, this will still need some preliminary work (to check and migrate over any references) which we will need to schedule in.\n\nOne last thing, do we still need a SSL certificate installed on the server (even if just a self signed one) in order to ensure that the connection between the origin server and Akamai is over a secure transport or is the whole network inside of Akamai considered secure (even if those connections are only over http). I seem to remember Dom saying that the origin server did need a cert installed even if just a self signed one). If this is the case then we'd need to figure out who is to complete this work IPSoft or ourselves. This would need installing on stage03/04 and web01-06. \n\nAlthough I do wonder, in light of everything now sitting behind Akamai whether it would make sense to install a self signed wildcard cert (no reason for a proper one as no one will see it) on stage03/04 and web01-06 so that those servers are setup to handle any sub sites under the london2012.com domain.\n\nProbably best Danny if you liaise with Russ on this / schedule any work in.\n\nthanks\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/31 18:28:47 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Thanks Jamie – did not mean to go direct to Danny on this when you had given such a comprehensive answer.\n\nRuss\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":14724144,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/31 18:39:00 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Russ,\n\nNo, I just meant could Danny (who was cc'd in) pick this ticket back up to figure out a schedule / thrash out the details with you for getting this work done.\n\nNot that Danny is my PA ;-) It's just that he has a better overall picture of our availability and probably has more time than me this week to discuss the finer details with yourself and Akamai.\n\nthanks\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/05 11:34:28 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Russ, regarding Jamie's list of tasks added in July:\r\n\r\n1/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to generate a CSR (certificate signing request) for festival.london2012.com \r\n2/ LOCOG need to order a SSL certificate using that CSR (for use on web01-06) \r\n3/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to instal the certificates on web01-06 \r\n4/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to update the Apache httpd.conf on web01-06 \r\n5/ Kitsite need to add a rule to each Apache httpd.conf to redirect form traffic to https and non-form traffic back to http \r\n6/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to restart all web servers \r\n7/ Kitsite need to update the HTML/JS to link to a https version of the signup form and the accessible version of the form [need to work out scope of those changes as the form is submitted via AJAX] \r\n8/ We also need to check that every other asset (image, js, css etc.) on the page can also be loaded via https to get round mixed content warnings, as the site is effectively one large JS app this could be a non trivial process (hard to tell without some investigation).\r\n\r\nI can confirm that this is where responsibility lies:\r\n\r\n1/ ipsoft need to generate a CSR (certificate signing request) for festival.london2012.com \r\n2/ LOCOG need to order a SSL certificate using that CSR (for use on web01-06) \r\n3/ ipsoft need to instal the certificates on web01-06 \r\n4/ Kitsite need to update the Apache httpd.conf on web01-06 \r\n5/ Kitsite need to add a rule to each Apache httpd.conf to redirect form traffic to https and non-form traffic back to http \r\n6/ ipsoft need to restart all web servers\r\n7/ Kitsite need to update the HTML/JS to link to a https version of the signup form and the accessible version of the form [need to work out scope of those changes as the form is submitted via AJAX] \r\n8/ We also need to check that every other asset (image, js, css etc.) on the page can also be loaded via https to get round mixed content warnings, as the site is effectively one large JS app this could be a non trivial process (hard to tell without some investigation).\r\n\r\nSo, if you are able to liaise with IPsoft, BT and Akamai to get the certificate installed we should be able to do the rest.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/20 14:07:10 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"As a follow up to this one and in particular with regard to items 2/ and 3/, our understanding is that the only way to have:\r\n -

Obviously if these are inbound links from other sites (rather than just links in Googles site index) then that is another matter and we probably do need to match them up.\n\nThe one downside to bulk redirects like this is the server load, as every request will need to first run a check to see if it matches any of those redirects, this may seem insignificant at first, but if we ended up with a couple of thousand redirects that could in turn end up adding a significant load to each request especially which when multiplied up by millions of requests \n\nIf the URL follow a pattern ie. the section name has changed or if any pages in /volunteering should now go to the /volunteer hub we may be able to write a single wildcard redirect which would be more efficient.\n\nSo in short, yes we can, if it's external urls from other sites we should (and can we pattern match any of them en-mass?). But if this is just a case of cleaning up Google index it may be better to let Google's indexer go about it's business and drop the old urls and reindex the new ones next time it spiders the site, rather than trying to force anything and clogging up each request with hundreds of redirect lookups (which may grow over time).\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/02/04 16:45:31 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Andy, let us know if you want us to redirect these (and send us the file) or if you think it's OK to let them fall out of Google index and get re indexed naturally.\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/02/04 16:54:42 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Jamie,\n\nI’ve asked David to take a look at this.

This will have a significant impact on how this is approached. I think we need to identify wildcards that would forward with a 301 to some new or higher level directory. I am assuming that most of these 10,000 URL are the result of some old URL structure change where no appropriate 301s where put in place when the changes were rolled out. \r\n\r\nThe primary strategy is to redirect as many of these 404 to the appropriate pages using 301 redirects. The secondary strategy would be to have a smart 404 page for the 404 not caught by our rule set that uses search to provide relevant links to what the user is probably looking for. This smart 404 page is very much (OPTIONAL) and will not be necessary if we think we can catch most of the 404 with a rule set.\"\r\n\r\n(I've attached the list of 404s.)\r\n\r\nCould you take a look and tweak your proposal accordingly - hopefully you'll be able to spot a pattern in the 404 so that rules can be used for the redirects.\r\n\r\nI've not commented on the sitemap part of the document as we're handling that elsewhere now.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAndy","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":18087822,"attachments":[{"size":1710817,"created_at":"2011/07/14 17:18:15 +0100","content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","token":"laeghwbmmsavd1h","id":56124981,"filename":"Web_crawl_errors_www_london2012_com_20110704T032803Z.csv","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/laeghwbmmsavd1h/?name=Web_crawl_errors_www_london2012_com_20110704T032803Z.csv"}]},{"created_at":"2011/08/01 15:44:19 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Hi, realise you're flat out at the moment, but could you let me know when you'll be able to take a look at this?","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":18087822,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/30 11:18:27 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"I propose the following:\r\n  1. 403's should yield the error page.\r\n  2.

So, for example,\r\n  http://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/blog/2011/01/made-up-pagename.php\r\nredirects to:\r\n  http://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/blog/2011/01/index.php\r\nAnother example:\r\n  http://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/visiting/getting-to-the-games/made-up-section/\r\nredirects to:\r\n  http://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/visiting/getting-to-the-games/index.php\r\n\r\nI have a couple more amendments to make to the 404 page, to link to a search page with a suitable search term, but I hope there is enough here for you to look at, and comment on?\r\n\r\nThe algorithm is (roughly).\r\nTake path, p.\r\nReplace /games/venues/games/ with /games/\r\nReplace /about/ with /about-us/\r\nReplace /sports/olympic/ with /games/olympic-sports/\r\nReplace /sports/ with /games/\r\nReplace /about-this-website/about-this-website/ with /about-this-website/\r\nReplace /about-this-website/get-involved/ with /get-involved/\r\n\r\nLook at p, \"path/to/some/page.php\"\r\nDoes \"path/to/some/page.php\" exist? if so, use it\r\nDoes \"path/to/some/index.php\" exist? if so, use it\r\nDoes \"path/to/index.php\" exist? if so, use it\r\nDoes \"path/index.php\" exist? if so, use it\r\n\r\nThere's also a tiny bit of magic to look for archived news stories.\r\n\r\nKieran","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591,"attachments":[{"size":337242,"created_at":"2011/11/22 14:00:06 +0000","content_type":"text/csv","token":"pygxgckgcugb5cv","id":82164062,"filename":"match.csv","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/pygxgckgcugb5cv/?name=match.csv"},{"size":77151,"created_at":"2011/11/22 14:00:12 +0000","content_type":"text/csv","token":"rundx2brfyvyte9","id":82164107,"filename":"nomatch.csv","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/rundx2brfyvyte9/?name=nomatch.csv"}]},{"created_at":"2011/11/23 17:45:34 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Kieran,\n\nThe stuff in the nomatch file looks reasonable. In the match file:\n\n1. There are a bunch of pages for /blog/includes/blog/... which would work better if we could strip out the initial /blog/includes.\n\n2. There are a few entries for /games/olympic-sport-competition-schedule/index.php which would ideally redirect to http://www.london2012.com/olympic-schedule.\n\n3. There’s a list of sports pages that we should be able to link. E.g. /games/olympic-sports/games/olympic-sports/archery.php should go to /archery.\n\nThose are the only ones that jump out – although I’ve only briefly scrolled through.\n\nYou’ve mentioned the 404 page with the search suggestion – when would this be displayed? If we’re redirecting further up the site hierarchy won’t all dead URLs be catered for, even if they ultimately display the homepage? Or were you planning on limiting the number of jumps up the hierarchy a user is taken?\n\nCheers,\nAndy\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":18087822,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/11/28 16:26:47 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Re. how many levels to jump up the hierarchy: this is up to you (and/or David) really.\r\nWe can, of course, go all the way to the top level but then again it might more sense to display a link to:\r\n \"Click here to search for 'new volleyball arena\"\"\r\nif you try to visit (for example) http://www.london2012.com/new-volleyball-arena.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/11/29 09:06:19 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"We'd be happy to go all the way up, which I assume would be simpler for you too.\r\n\r\nWhere and how can we test this?","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":18087822,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/11/29 11:56:52 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Right, I've implemented your suggestions:\r\n\r\n> We'd be happy to go all the way up\r\nThe \"search\" algorithm now goes \"all the way up\" - i.e. in the last resort, it will return the homepage.\r\n\r\n> 1.
