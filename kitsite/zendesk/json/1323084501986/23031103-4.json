In theory if we could get Michael in for a months he possible could rewrite it, but then I expect we'd end up with another two dozen new issues as a result of doing that).\r\n\r\nLooking at the templates and how we could restructure them so we could use a <content:picture> container is however realistic, although a bit open ended / more a design issue.","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/06/01 12:26:25 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Zara, apologies for taking so long to get back to you on this one, but this is a somewhat intractable problem, without a realistic timescale. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is another solution which we haven't mentioned: refactoring the page template so that instead of inline images, we place image containers in specific locations on the page. This may even be a better solution than allowing inline images if you are likely to have more people entering content over the next 12 months, because it enforces layout more than adding images inline on an ad hoc basis.\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize, the options are:\r\n\r\n1.

Story so far:\r\n- Zara raised an issue several months ago with image editing in sports pages;\r\n- We spent some time looking at it but could not find a satisfactory resolution;\r\n- Zara asked us to come up with a time estimate for solving the issue, which we did not do after which the issue got parked;\r\n- Last month, we spotted the ticket and updated it with a couple of suggestions for workarounds;\r\n- This month I brazenly attempted to close the ticket with the inevitable response from Liz.\r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful if you could give us some guidance on how high a priority addressing this issue is likely to be and how you would like us to proceed.\r\n\r\nIn particular, is this issue currently a problem for CMS users; are you expecting a larger number of people to be accessing the CMS without access to Firefox over the next 10 months or so; and is the suggestion of refactoring the page likely to be a solution that you are interested in?\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]}],"nice_id":2178,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/12/03 11:46:45 +0000","field_110059":"","channel":null,"entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:51 +0000","resolution_time":null,"priority_id":2,"current_tags":"billable facebook level_0 none_required twitter","assignee_id":3640926,"permissions":{},"updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:43:40 +0000","req_name":"Zara Rabinowicz","ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2011/07/12 16:37:11 +0100","solved_at":null,"original_recipient_address":null,"field_147056":"billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/11/08 15:43:40 +0000","via_id":4,"subject":"Issues with Picture deletion and uploading in the CMS","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","group_id":61946,"problem_id":null,"submitter_id":20967651,"base_score":40,"latest_recipients":"support+id2178@postcms.zendesk.com Tom.Price-Stephens@london2012.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":"Liz Goulding, Tom Price Stephens","linkings":[],"status_id":2,"description":"Hi\n\nI'm trying to add in new images to the Sports pages, and delete the existing mascot pictures and replace them with smaller thumbnails.\nWhen I click delete the page dimensions change, and when I click insert, no image appears.\n\nHave enclosed screen grabs to demo this.\n\nCheers\nZara\n\nZara Rabinowicz\nAssistant New Media Producer\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\nwww.london2012.com\nwww.facebook.com/london2012\nwww.twitter.com/london2012","score":40,"organization_id":40584,"assignee_name":"Danny Sofer","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:56 +0000","updated_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:56 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:46:45 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/11 11:58:10 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"2"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:57 +0000","updated_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:57 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:56 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/25 11:11:48 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:56 +0000","updated_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:56 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:46:45 +0000","updated_at":"2011/07/11 11:31:22 +0100","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:46:45 +0000","updated_at":"2011/07/11 11:31:22 +0100","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:57 +0000","updated_at":"2011/07/11 11:31:32 +0100","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:57 +0000","updated_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:57 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:57 +0000","updated_at":"2011/07/11 11:31:32 +0100","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/01/25 11:11:48 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/25 11:11:48 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/07/11 11:31:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/07/11 11:31:22 +0100","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"0"}],"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":20967651},{"comments":[{"created_at":"2010/11/18 12:36:18 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"\"it is always preferable to include a page’s primary keywords in a title tag, and considering the site’s poor ranking for Olympic- related keywords in the United States, it is vital to improve the title tag.\"\r\n\r\n\"Home Page Title Tag Recommendation: London 2012 Olympic Games Official Website | London2012.com\"\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2010/11/18 12:36:43 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Liz to decide what the rules should be.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2010/11/22 12:17:34 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Due date set as Jan 31.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/06/29 10:49:53 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Liz, I have done another sweep of tickets this morning and spotted this one.
