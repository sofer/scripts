In this case that is unlikely to happen (I think that section is fairly set in stone) but in other cases it may be an issue.\n\nIn terms of the links, I think we added these in as well? If not all those links are editable in the CMS so you can just add them in (although as they all have adfarm.mediplex.com urls they will be seen by the CMS as external pages and hence may get 'external link' icons - this is done deep down in the publication layer and isn't easy to change).\n\nHappy to have a chat, although tomorrow would be better than today.\n\nbtw. can you not share your stat data from Google Analytics with TFL rather than us adding yet another set of ad tracking tags to the templates/pages?\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2012/01/17 11:14:10 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"This support ticket has been automatically closed.\r\n\r\nFor support assistance please contact support@kitsite.com\r\nFor general information concerning Kitsite or PostCMS  please contact info@kitsite.com\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nKitsite","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]}],"permissions":{},"nice_id":4726,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/08/11 14:52:07 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","resolution_time":3817,"priority_id":0,"current_tags":"bill_to_oda feed its level_0 none_required pages","assignee_id":3640926,"channel":null,"updated_at":"2012/01/17 11:14:11 +0000","req_name":"Tom Price Stephens","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","ticket_id":101993481,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/08/11 16:23:30 +0100","updated_at":"2012/01/17 11:14:10 +0000","ticket_id":101993481,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","ticket_id":101993481,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/08/11 16:23:30 +0100","ticket_id":101993481,"value":"bill_to_oda"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","ticket_id":101993481,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/08/11 16:23:30 +0100","updated_at":"2011/08/11 16:23:30 +0100","ticket_id":101993481,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/08/11 16:23:30 +0100","updated_at":"2012/01/17 11:14:10 +0000","ticket_id":101993481,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","updated_at":"2012/01/17 11:14:10 +0000","ticket_id":101993481,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","ticket_id":101993481,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","updated_at":"2012/01/17 11:14:10 +0000","ticket_id":101993481,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","ticket_id":101993481,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/08/11 11:10:56 +0100","ticket_id":101993481,"value":"0"}],"ticket_type_id":1,"status_updated_at":"2012/01/17 11:14:10 +0000","solved_at":"2012/01/17 11:14:10 +0000","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"bill_to_oda","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2012/01/17 11:14:10 +0000","score":20,"via_id":4,"subject":"Tagging travel advice for business pages.","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"submitter_id":25108633,"base_score":20,"latest_recipients":"support+idMR45-5JMS@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"linkings":[],"status_id":3,"description":": Hi,\n\nA piece of work has arisen tagging some of the travel advice for business pages.\n\nAttached is a spreadsheet with the required changes.\n\nThis involves inserting an iframe into three pages, and tagging links on three others.\n\nI suspect the spreadsheet won't be obvious so if whoever picks this up gives me a call.\n\nIt is something the ODA is paying for so if we can cost it and go ahead with it, we can then feed it back to them,\n\nThanks,\n\nTom\n\nTom Price-Stephens\nAssistant New Media Producer\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012  000 Extension: 381\nMobile: +44 7540 258 453\nwww.london2012.com\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

Therefore I would suggest it doesnt' make sense to split the task.\n\n- Do we even want/need ExpiresByType headers set by Apache for Images? That's a real question, which I am not 100% sure of the answer too. In the case of images I'd imagine it would be safe to reply on Akamai to set the cache settings for all images (pages are different as some may be cacheable and others not) and remove the ExpiresByType rules for images from the Apache config completely.\n\nJamie\n\n---\n\n# Add expires headers to images \nExpiresActive On\nExpiresByType image/gif \"modification plus 1 hour\"\nExpiresByType image/jpg \"modification plus 1 hour\"\nExpiresByType image/png \"modification plus 1 hour\"","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2012/01/13 12:58:20 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Jamie got in first, but I was going to say:\r\n\r\nI don't understand where that \"Cache-Control: max-age=-147864\" is coming from.\r\n\r\nOn staging, it does look like we do have some sort of cache control on images.\r\n\r\n> grep \"Expires\" /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf\r\nExpiresActive On\r\nExpiresByType image/gif \"modification plus 1 hour\"\r\nExpiresByType image/jpg \"modification plus 1 hour\"\r\nExpiresByType image/png \"modification plus 1 hour\"\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't bear any relation to a max-age of \"-147864\" on live. \r\n\r\nStumped.
