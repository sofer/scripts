This applies to both versions of the\nform. Would Kitsite be able to widen the box so that all text is\nvisible?\n\nThere is also a problem with the licence expiry date for those who\nhave an existing licence. A lot of expiry dates are 31/07/2012 and the\nwebsite is not allowing applicants to submit forms with that date as\nit does not cover the whole Games period (although applicants are\nsupposed to show a valid licence for Games Time, in practice these may\nbe not be renewed until nearer the time in which case we just need to\nsee a valid licence for the time of the application).  Is this a\nKitsite query, or one for James do you think? I’m not sure where the\nresponsibilities lie.\n\nGive me a bell if you need me to clarify anything.\n\nThanks,\n\nSarah Clarke\nProject Manager, Advertising & Trading\nOlympic Delivery Authority\nDirect line:  +44 (0) 203 023 6963","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2012/01/18 11:17:10 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Marked as high.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2012/01/18 12:35:46 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Simon,\n\n1) ‘type of licence’ boxes does not show the full licence/regs name\n\nDo you mean the drop down isn't fully expanding - width wise - on some browsers or is it actually missing options?\n\n2) licence expiry date\n\nAre you getting an error message at the top of the form when you enter \"31/07/2012\" (we can't see to recreate this) or is it an error when you import the data into ION (obviouyl if the latter it's an issue that needs to be raised with ION).\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2012/01/18 12:44:50 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Thanks for investigating.

This applies to both versions of the\nform. Would Kitsite be able to widen the box so that all text is\nvisible?\n\nThere is also a problem with the licence expiry date for those who\nhave an existing licence. A lot of expiry dates are 31/07/2012 and the\nwebsite is not allowing applicants to submit forms with that date as\nit does not cover the whole Games period (although applicants are\nsupposed to show a valid licence for Games Time, in practice these may\nbe not be renewed until nearer the time in which case we just need to\nsee a valid licence for the time of the application).  Is this a\nKitsite query, or one for James do you think? I’m not sure where the\nresponsibilities lie.\n\nGive me a bell if you need me to clarify anything.\n\nThanks,\n\nSarah Clarke\nProject Manager, Advertising & Trading\nOlympic Delivery Authority\nDirect line:  +44 (0) 203 023 6963","organization_id":40584,"field_177410":null,"assignee_name":"Lars Bortfeldt","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3734643},{"comments":[{"created_at":"2012/01/18 15:01:27 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"We need to make sure that they don't slap us with a bill.

When I unlock them, they occasionally allow me to make a change then appear locked again. This has happened on the home page and the most recent news article.\n> \n> A problem with captions displaying on the home page. See pic 1 attached.\n> \n> Have encountered a variety of error messages while attempting to save and publish pages. See pictures 2, 3 and 4.\n> \n> Copy mysteriously disappearing, see picture 5. The full article had been added to the site. Mysteriously everything below paragraph two vanished, including the last sentence of the paragraph. The page is now not allowing me to make any changes (see error messages described above).\n> \n> A standfirst written to accompany one of the photo essays also disappeared. I thought perhaps I had done this myself unintentionally, but now I am not so sure. It seems the CMS is somehow deleting copy when other changes are made and saved to a page. As you can imagine, this is very frustrating -- especially in the case of the standfirst, which I did not have saved and now need to re-write.\n> \n> Perhaps I am doing something wrong, however, I have successfully carried out these tasks before many times.\n> \n> My Afghan colleague has also experienced problems attempting to upload to the Jamiya site.

Also, renaming pages, see picture 7, and updating the new PACT site.\n> \n> Let me know what you think.\n> \n> All best wishes,\n> \n> Sam\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n----------------------------------------------\noffice: 0207 378 6655\nhttp://www.kitsite.com/\n\nStudio 41, Clink Street Studios\nClink Street\nLondon\nSE1 9DG","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[{"size":567844,"created_at":"2011/07/13 12:02:47 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"avqnm5l4z7qiv1r","id":54375577,"filename":"Picture_1.png","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/avqnm5l4z7qiv1r/?name=Picture_1.png","is_public":true},{"size":241448,"created_at":"2011/07/13 12:02:49 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"wwxmajbtttxoysg","id":54375597,"filename":"Picture_2.png","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/wwxmajbtttxoysg/?name=Picture_2.png","is_public":true},{"size":377731,"created_at":"2011/07/13 12:02:51 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"95tkhutq1oehy0q","id":54375607,"filename":"Picture_3.png","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/95tkhutq1oehy0q/?name=Picture_3.png","is_public":true},{"size":165420,"created_at":"2011/07/13 12:02:52 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"zjitblz5uowbmnn","id":54375617,"filename":"Picture_4.png","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/zjitblz5uowbmnn/?name=Picture_4.png","is_public":true},{"size":540609,"created_at":"2011/07/13 12:02:54 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"gcd6gaz0npu0z1p","id":54375627,"filename":"Picture_5.png","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/gcd6gaz0npu0z1p/?name=Picture_5.png","is_public":true},{"size":242862,"created_at":"2011/07/13 12:02:56 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"9dlhzafckircuaa","id":54375637,"filename":"Picture_6.png","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/9dlhzafckircuaa/?name=Picture_6.png","is_public":true},{"size":272988,"created_at":"2011/07/13 12:02:57 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"xwwqatrphnnhcxd","id":54375647,"filename":"Picture_7.png","url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/xwwqatrphnnhcxd/?name=Picture_7.png","is_public":true}]},{"created_at":"2011/07/13 17:51:41 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Most of these issues seem related to each other and coming from the ftp-password locking caused by publisher.

As an action like that could cause a huge number of redirects being written out. If you do need to rename sections with may sub-pages it may be better to use a single regular expression based mod_rewrite (or equivalent server side redirect) rule in a server config.\n\nThe other important thing to check here is that your CMS tracks all the previous redirects in such a way that they all point to a single canonical 'current' url, as opposed to them chaining, or else you may end up with \"to many redirect' errors.\n\nWe also implement what we term 'SEO urls'\nThese are less 'redirects' in the 301 sense and more 'neat' short urls (ie. /basketball) that are inserted into href tags by the CMS instead of the full path to the page (ie. /sport/basketball.php). With these pages the name of the 'short' name of page stays the same regardless of where it lives in the site structure. However I think this may be more specific to our current CMS implementation which has a strong notion of a hierarchical site structure that mates that of the live site in the editorial interfaces.\nhttps://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/admin/seopaths/\n\nIn terms of how to implement the redirects, that will largely depend on your CMS, but I would say you would want to do this somewhere centrally (ie. a server config, a controller, a global request handler) rather than physically replacing the old pages with a page that does the redirect (otherwise you run the risk of having redirects to redirects).\n\nI hope that answers your questions..\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2012/01/19 09:21:30 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Jamie,\nThanks so much for getting back to me.

Everyone here is delighted with it. There are now a few\nlast things we need to do to complete the site before I leave the ODA\n(in December). \n\nI have outlined the final tasks below. Please can you take a look and\nsend over a quote for this work? I think we will need a quick chat to go\nthrough all of this in detail so that I'm as clear as I can be on what\nwe require - how about Monday?\n\n\n\n1.       Analytics - we are being harassed about measuring the number of\npeople visiting the site, which is absolutely something we should have\nthought about before. What is the cost to build the capacity to measure\nthe number of people visiting the home page? And also another cost for\nthe home page and theme pages? This is quite urgent, so it would be\ngreat to get this set up ASAP.\n\n \n\n2.       Accessibility - there is an issue with the accessibility style\nsheets, as in they don't look great. AbilityNet picked up that the pages\nshould 'render with a layout similar to the normal site, but with bigger\ntext and more contrasting colours'. I know you've advised that doing\nthat would mean effectively designing a new CSS layout/design purely for\nthe accessible versions of each page - please can we get a quote for\nredesigning the accessible versions of the pages? \n\n \n\n3.       Flash plug-in - there is an issue with the London 2012\nlogo/scrolling pictures on the home page in Internet Explorer. I think\nthis is something to do with 'flash plug-ins', as this was the error\nmessage that came up when we loaded the site in Firefox at the ICE.\nPlease can you explore and rectify?\n\n\n\n4.       Alt text on scrolling pictures - we need the alt text to show\nas a yellow box when hovering over the images so that people know where\nthey are. I think you have said this will require a component/function\nadding so may have cost implications. Can we get a quote for this\nplease?\n\n\n\n5.       Archaeology navigation - in order to get the nesting right (to\nmirror the site map) we had to lose the top level menu when you click on\n'The investigations' and 'The sites'. This is not ideal, as it simply\ndoesn't look great. What options do we have to amend/fix this?\n\n\n\n6.       Full list of publications - The project team want us to add an\noption on each theme page for a full list of publications per theme (ie\na list of all micro reports, case studies, champion products and\nresearch summaries for Sustainability). Can we add a link, or another\nbox for this? Would be great to go through the options and costs for\nthis.\n\n\n\n7.       External links page - we would like to add in External Links\nfor each theme page. I reckon there will be around five external\nwebsites for us to link out to, per theme. Maybe this could sit under\nthe 'related links' on the right? Also would be great to discuss\noptions.\n\n \n\n8.       Technical Overviews - we are publishing some technical\noverviews of the project, which are external papers that we just need to\nlink to. Because these are overviews of the project, and not\ntheme-specific, are we able to add a tab at the top, which takes you to\na page about the overviews? It just needs to be a page, with information\nabout three organisations delivering the overviews. \n\n \n\n9.       Case study summaries - there are a number of case studies being\npublished by external organisations next year that we have the\nsummaries/abstracts for. We need these summaries to go on the website\nwith links to the full case studies/publishers. I suggest that these go\nunder the case studies section, or we have another 'box' for case study\nsummaries. However, these aren't documents to upload (as with case\nstudies), so there will be no thumbnail and no physical PDF to link to.\nIt will just need to be a generic image, with the summary/abstract to go\ninto the text box next to the thumbnail, and the link will take you to\nan external website (rather than a PDF). Hope this makes sense? The only\nother catch is that the links won't be available until next year! Best\nto talk through this one!\n\n \n\n10.   LOCOG testing of the website - Colin Miller has been continuing to\ntest the website since we've gone live and has picked up a few\n'aesthetic niggles'. I have asked him to outline what these are and will\nget back to you ASAP. They are not expected to be extensive and I'm\nhoping we can fix these in-house.\n\n \n\n \n\nHope this all makes sense. As suggested, let's catch up early next week\nand then get a lump-sum for all of these changes. I want to ensure that\nwe are very clear from the outset and that you are paid for all the\nextra work you are doing.\n\n \n\nHope you have a lovely weekend.

Everyone here is delighted with it. There are now a few\nlast things we need to do to complete the site before I leave the ODA\n(in December). \n\nI have outlined the final tasks below. Please can you take a look and\nsend over a quote for this work? I think we will need a quick chat to go\nthrough all of this in detail so that I'm as clear as I can be on what\nwe require - how about Monday?\n\n\n\n1.       Analytics - we are being harassed about measuring the number of\npeople visiting the site, which is absolutely something we should have\nthought about before. What is the cost to build the capacity to measure\nthe number of people visiting the home page? And also another cost for\nthe home page and theme pages? This is quite urgent, so it would be\ngreat to get this set up ASAP.\n\n \n\n2.       Accessibility - there is an issue with the accessibility style\nsheets, as in they don't look great. AbilityNet picked up that the pages\nshould 'render with a layout similar to the normal site, but with bigger\ntext and more contrasting colours'. I know you've advised that doing\nthat would mean effectively designing a new CSS layout/design purely for\nthe accessible versions of each page - please can we get a quote for\nredesigning the accessible versions of the pages? \n\n \n\n3.       Flash plug-in - there is an issue with the London 2012\nlogo/scrolling pictures on the home page in Internet Explorer. I think\nthis is something to do with 'flash plug-ins', as this was the error\nmessage that came up when we loaded the site in Firefox at the ICE.\nPlease can you explore and rectify?\n\n\n\n4.       Alt text on scrolling pictures - we need the alt text to show\nas a yellow box when hovering over the images so that people know where\nthey are. I think you have said this will require a component/function\nadding so may have cost implications. Can we get a quote for this\nplease?\n\n\n\n5.       Archaeology navigation - in order to get the nesting right (to\nmirror the site map) we had to lose the top level menu when you click on\n'The investigations' and 'The sites'. This is not ideal, as it simply\ndoesn't look great. What options do we have to amend/fix this?\n\n\n\n6.       Full list of publications - The project team want us to add an\noption on each theme page for a full list of publications per theme (ie\na list of all micro reports, case studies, champion products and\nresearch summaries for Sustainability). Can we add a link, or another\nbox for this? Would be great to go through the options and costs for\nthis.\n\n\n\n7.       External links page - we would like to add in External Links\nfor each theme page. I reckon there will be around five external\nwebsites for us to link out to, per theme. Maybe this could sit under\nthe 'related links' on the right? Also would be great to discuss\noptions.\n\n \n\n8.       Technical Overviews - we are publishing some technical\noverviews of the project, which are external papers that we just need to\nlink to. Because these are overviews of the project, and not\ntheme-specific, are we able to add a tab at the top, which takes you to\na page about the overviews? It just needs to be a page, with information\nabout three organisations delivering the overviews. \n\n \n\n9.       Case study summaries - there are a number of case studies being\npublished by external organisations next year that we have the\nsummaries/abstracts for. We need these summaries to go on the website\nwith links to the full case studies/publishers. I suggest that these go\nunder the case studies section, or we have another 'box' for case study\nsummaries. However, these aren't documents to upload (as with case\nstudies), so there will be no thumbnail and no physical PDF to link to.\nIt will just need to be a generic image, with the summary/abstract to go\ninto the text box next to the thumbnail, and the link will take you to\nan external website (rather than a PDF). Hope this makes sense? The only\nother catch is that the links won't be available until next year! Best\nto talk through this one!\n\n \n\n10.   LOCOG testing of the website - Colin Miller has been continuing to\ntest the website since we've gone live and has picked up a few\n'aesthetic niggles'. I have asked him to outline what these are and will\nget back to you ASAP. They are not expected to be extensive and I'm\nhoping we can fix these in-house.\n\n \n\n \n\nHope this all makes sense. As suggested, let's catch up early next week\nand then get a lump-sum for all of these changes. I want to ensure that\nwe are very clear from the outset and that you are paid for all the\nextra work you are doing.\n\n \n\nHope you have a lovely weekend. Speak next week.\n\n \n\nIndy Rihal\n\nMarketing Manager\nCommunications\nDirect line:  +44 (0) 203 023 6457\n\nBlackberry:   +44 (0) 776 055 4135\n\n \n\nOlympic Delivery Authority\nMailpoint: 7A\n23rd Floor, One Churchill Place\n\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\nwww.london2012.com <http://www.london2012.com> \n\n \n\nFind out what is going on at London 2012 HQ - http://blog.london2012.com\n\n\nInformation owned by ODA\n\nPlease delete if you are not the intended recipient\n\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">This email and any attachments are for the attention of the addressee(s) only.\nIt may also be confidential.
