Maybe we could setup a call re. this?\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]}],"nice_id":5876,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/12/07 12:34:40 +0000","field_358835":"0.1","field_110059":"","channel":null,"field_97116":"0.5","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","ticket_id":145486028,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","updated_at":"2012/01/09 15:37:32 +0000","ticket_id":145486028,"value":"0.5"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","ticket_id":145486028,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","updated_at":"2012/01/09 15:37:50 +0000","ticket_id":145486028,"value":"billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","updated_at":"2012/01/09 15:37:50 +0000","ticket_id":145486028,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","updated_at":"2012/01/11 14:15:42 +0000","ticket_id":145486028,"value":"0.6"},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","updated_at":"2012/01/09 15:37:32 +0000","ticket_id":145486028,"value":"0.1"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","ticket_id":145486028,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","ticket_id":145486028,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","ticket_id":145486028,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","ticket_id":145486028,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","updated_at":"2011/12/05 12:45:21 +0000","ticket_id":145486028,"value":"1"}],"resolution_time":843,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"authorized billable this_week","assignee_id":3686603,"updated_at":"2012/01/09 15:37:50 +0000","req_name":"Tom Price Stephens","ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2012/01/09 15:37:33 +0000","solved_at":"2012/01/09 15:37:33 +0000","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/12/07 12:34:40 +0000","score":30,"via_id":0,"subject":"HTML5 videos","recipient":null,"organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"linkings":[],"submitter_id":3640926,"base_score":30,"latest_recipients":null,"due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"problem_id":null,"status_id":3,"description":"Tom, I think we are still waiting to hear from TwoFour on the HTML5 implementation of their player.","permissions":{},"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":"0.6","assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":25108633},{"comments":[{"created_at":"2012/01/05 18:50:04 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Hi,\nI was testing www.londonpreparesseries.com and one small image http://www.londonpreparesseries.com/images/logobmx.jpg is missing and giving 404, this image is refer on multiple pages.\n\nThanks\nSharique Shaikh\nBusiness Technology Services(BTS)\nDirect line:  +44 (0)30 2012 0205\nMobile: 07853902487\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nOne Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.
