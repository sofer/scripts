there is also no going back once we make it rich text.\n\nThere should be no side effects of making it rich text, the main reason we don't do it is that styling issues can creep in with rich text and the CSS for those areas may not be as forgiving of a stray html tag as the main body areas (which is designed to accept all forms of rich text markup).\n\nLong / short of it, if you need it we can do it, if it's just a \"nice to have\" it may be worth thinking twice about.\n\nOn the positive side I think we have already converted those boxes elsewhere and haven't seem any major side effects of doing that.\n\n* I'm probably just being pessimistic, but if this does cause issues it won't on this page now where we see the issue, it will probably be in 2 months when someone pastes some text in
