The para returns are not showing on the index page – all the text runs as one.\n\n2. Is it possible to add a break within the text so that not all the text shows on the index page (as per our normal blog)?\n\n3. Can you remind me how we assign a team name / avatar to a blog post – can we just enter them as normal authors i.e. Aberdeen instead of a person’s name? [You did tell me this but I have forgotten...]\n\n4. Meet the Young Leaders landing page http://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/young-leaders/meet/ - the yellow arrows at the top of the scrolling device don’t look quite right – are they supposed to sit on thumbnail photos like this?\n\nAlso – on the live site, something very odd has happened with the news feed top right:\nhttp://www.london2012.com/young-leaders/index.php You can’t see the actual news stories, just ‘More’, plus when you click ‘More’ it takes you to a French news story.

The form changes are shown on the attached doc: it's the addition of one new field, plus tweaks to the values in Performance skills (some new values, some removed values). I'm hoping these are not huge. You will\nThe date for go-live is Weds 11 January, but obviously we are still using the phase 1 form for Olympic auditions until the end of Monday. That means these changes would be required to be made and pushed live on Tues, 10 Jan.  Is that possible?\nThe process is:\n\n*         Olympic auditions form closes Monday evening. Application Stage II form is moved offline to a new URL .  The old URL /games/ceremonies/get-involved/ceremonies-application-stage-two.php shows a static \"Thank you but Olympic auditions are now closed\" page.\n\n*         Tuesday - make changes to form as indicated, and change campaign ID (new value tba by Campbell). Test to ensure our system and Campbell's system still talk to each other.\n\n*         Weds - stage 2 form opens with minor changes at a new URL. I suggest / games/ceremonies/get-involved/paralympic-ceremonies-application-stage-two.php\nSome time in February (tba) -  stage II form taken offline and replaced with Static pages\nIs that okay?
