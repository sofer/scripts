The only reason for the staging server is so we can stop syncing and test out significant changes to the site or to the server configuration files. But this is not something we do on a normal day to day basis. In fact there is no way to show events only on the staging server as GDP will need to out the event live so that it will appear in their search API and in turn in our search results.\n\nCan I just check that you aren't doing something in the GDP system that would stop the events being sent to us in the feed and/or appearing in GDP's search results API ?\n\nthanks\n\nJamie","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":3686603,"created_at":"2012/04/12 17:31:53 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"\"The field ‘excluded from feed’ has been ticked in these events as instruction from the events database team so they won’t be live.\"\n\nAh, that would explain the problem...\n\nThat checkbox is doing *exactly* what it says, namely ‘exclud(ing the event) from (the) feed’ which is why we wont' have received it / it won't be appearing on the festival site (staging or live).\n\n* I should reiterate, despite it's name, there is nothing special about the \"staging server\" it does not (without manual intervention) give you the ability to 'stage' or 'preview' an event or page prior to it going live. Furthermore in the case of event pages (as opposed to template or config changes) there is no way of staging an event page, as the very notion of sending it to us from GDP will cause the event to simultaneously appear in the live GDP search results.\n\n** is there no method in GDP's system of previewing an event before it is sent to us? that would the natural/sensible place to preview an event.","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":161948746,"created_at":"2012/04/12 17:32:22 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Thanks, apparently last November events appeared on the staging website without being live..

In theory if we could get Michael in for a months he possible could rewrite it, but then I expect we'd end up with another two dozen new issues as a result of doing that).\r\n\r\nLooking at the templates and how we could restructure them so we could use a <content:picture> container is however realistic, although a bit open ended / more a design issue.","via_id":0,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":3640926,"created_at":"2011/06/01 12:26:25 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Zara, apologies for taking so long to get back to you on this one, but this is a somewhat intractable problem, without a realistic timescale. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is another solution which we haven't mentioned: refactoring the page template so that instead of inline images, we place image containers in specific locations on the page. This may even be a better solution than allowing inline images if you are likely to have more people entering content over the next 12 months, because it enforces layout more than adding images inline on an ad hoc basis.\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize, the options are:\r\n\r\n1.

Obviously if these are inbound links from other sites (rather than just links in Googles site index) then that is another matter and we probably do need to match them up.\n\nThe one downside to bulk redirects like this is the server load, as every request will need to first run a check to see if it matches any of those redirects, this may seem insignificant at first, but if we ended up with a couple of thousand redirects that could in turn end up adding a significant load to each request especially which when multiplied up by millions of requests \n\nIf the URL follow a pattern ie. the section name has changed or if any pages in /volunteering should now go to the /volunteer hub we may be able to write a single wildcard redirect which would be more efficient.\n\nSo in short, yes we can, if it's external urls from other sites we should (and can we pattern match any of them en-mass?). But if this is just a case of cleaning up Google index it may be better to let Google's indexer go about it's business and drop the old urls and reindex the new ones next time it spiders the site, rather than trying to force anything and clogging up each request with hundreds of redirect lookups (which may grow over time).\n\nJamie","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":3686603,"created_at":"2011/02/04 16:45:31 +0000","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Andy, let us know if you want us to redirect these (and send us the file) or if you think it's OK to let them fall out of Google index and get re indexed naturally.\r\n\r\nJamie","via_id":0,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":18087822,"created_at":"2011/02/04 16:54:42 +0000","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Jamie,\n\nI’ve asked David to take a look at this.

Response from David on the 404 proposal is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have included an export of your Google crawl results and unfortunately we are talking about more like 10,000 URL than 300. This will have a significant impact on how this is approached. I think we need to identify wildcards that would forward with a 301 to some new or higher level directory. I am assuming that most of these 10,000 URL are the result of some old URL structure change where no appropriate 301s where put in place when the changes were rolled out. \r\n\r\nThe primary strategy is to redirect as many of these 404 to the appropriate pages using 301 redirects. The secondary strategy would be to have a smart 404 page for the 404 not caught by our rule set that uses search to provide relevant links to what the user is probably looking for. This smart 404 page is very much (OPTIONAL) and will not be necessary if we think we can catch most of the 404 with a rule set.\"\r\n\r\n(I've attached the list of 404s.)\r\n\r\nCould you take a look and tweak your proposal accordingly - hopefully you'll be able to spot a pattern in the 404 so that rules can be used for the redirects.\r\n\r\nI've not commented on the sitemap part of the document as we're handling that elsewhere now.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAndy","via_id":0,"attachments":[{"content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","created_at":"2011/07/14 17:18:15 +0100","filename":"Web_crawl_errors_www_london2012_com_20110704T032803Z.csv","id":56124981,"is_public":true,"size":1710817,"token":"laeghwbmmsavd1h","url":"https://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/laeghwbmmsavd1h/?name=Web_crawl_errors_www_london2012_com_20110704T032803Z.csv"}]},{"author_id":18087822,"created_at":"2011/08/01 15:44:19 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Hi, realise you're flat out at the moment, but could you let me know when you'll be able to take a look at this?","via_id":0,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":3663591,"created_at":"2011/08/30 11:18:27 +0100","is_public":false,"type":"Comment","value":"I propose the following:\r\n  1. 403's should yield the error page.\r\n  2.
