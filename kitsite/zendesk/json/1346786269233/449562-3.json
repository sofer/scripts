The danger is that a users browser may (in the past) have attached application/octet-stream to some other application other than a PDF reader.\n\nJamie\n\n---\n\nHow the PDF is handled (ie view in the browser vs download vs view in acrobat) is set by the users browser.

The downside to this is the users machine won't know it's a PDF file as we've told the browser it's something else (it's only the file extension .pdf that means the PDF sometimes gets reunited with its correct type once downloaded - but this isn't guaranteed)\n\nI would suggest a a more correct solution is to put a comment under the link telling users to right click if they wish to save the file somewhere on their machine. \n\nThe solution (of setting an unknown file type) is a hack (we would be deliberately sending incorrect information to the browser, to force the browser to ask us what to do) which may well have its own issues. \n\n2/ urls / redirects\n\nwww.london2012.com and festival.london2012.com are separate domains/sites there is no sensible way of mapping /festival to festival.london2012.com that is transparent to the user.\n\nAlthough the official URL may be www.london2012.com/festival the site is festival.london2012.com. Not only are they different domain names, they are different web sites, on different servers.\n\nwww.london2012.com/festival is simply a redirect to where the site is hosted.\n\nTo make the site appear under /festival without the URL changing, we'd actually need to move the site so that it physically lived within the /festival of the main www site (which technically isn't possible)\n\nSee also /shop and shop.london2012.com and /tickets an tickets.london2012.com\n\nHope that makes sense \n\nJamie\n\nSent from my iPad","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":161948746,"created_at":"2012/05/01 09:40:12 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Hi Jamie\n\n\n1.

It is also worth bearing in mind that for an individual user the way PDF's are handled (by their browser) on the Festival site will be exactly the same as they are handled on other sites.\n\nI realise the brochure has lots of extra information in it and it's nice to have a PDF you can browse offline on a tablet device like an iPad (I often find that an overview or daily PDF I can print out is especially useful at festivals and conferences).

Although we will need to setup new accounts and API keys for yourself (or your developers) to access these API's. I expect you will also require a small amount of handholding / help in understanding the format of these API's (as they were a one off there is no documentation for them). Although we would expect the effort required to get you up to speed / for us to make any necessary changes to suit you import/requirements to be modest (for example we worked with the games time developers to migrate the current content to the games time website in just over a week). It probably makes sense for us to agree on a rough allowance of days towards to end of the summer with regards to this work (let me know if you would like me to make an extremely rough estimate now for budgetary purposes, say for 5 days work on helping you manage the export, although do bear in mind that this may change, up or down, once we understand your exact needs in more detail)\r\n\r\nIn terms of other things that may (or may not) be required (as I understood it, it was only the content you are interested in and not snapshots of the site as fully formed thing). \r\n\r\n- Content that falls outside of key content (news, blogs, photos, press releases, publications) ie. the \"about us\" or \"sponsors\" page.\r\nThere is a large amount of content that falls outside of what we have termed above as 'key content' this ranges from  the \"about us\" page to the \"young leaders\" or \"get involved\" sections.\r\nAll this content is available for export in a similar format to news, blogs etc. but may be much less well formed (ie. a news story always has a date, author, summary paragraph etc.) but a hub page for  \"young leaders\" may juts be a few paragraphs of text and/or a list of team members. The good news is that it will all be available if required, the downside is we may need to write some additional export API's for you and spend a little longer working with you so that you can make use/sense of this data (although our export format is fairly self describing).\r\n\r\n- Images\r\nI assume LOOCG have the rights to all the images (that they have received via Getty) and this is simply handed onto you as part of the legacy agreement.\r\n\r\n- Festival site\r\nI am assuming that the content from the festival site (festival.london2012.com) will not make us the museum site, do let me know if my assumption is wrong as although the site can be exported it may require slightly more effort in terms of creating that export.\r\n\r\n- Switch off of the website vs the CMS\r\nIt may be the case that LOCOG IT decide to switch of the website prior to us switching off the CMS. The current 2012 CMS instance will stay live till at least the end of the year (as we manage that part). However the BT web infrastructure hosting the current site may be switched off post the games in September (waiting on confirmation on this either way). This shouldn't present a problem as all the content will still be held in our CMS/database. Where it may impact you is if you wish to view/navigate the current website in preparation for the Museum site (in the worse case we could republish the site elsewhere for you to view it if required).\r\n\r\n- A complete (working) 'snapshot' of the website (looking as it does now) as static HTML. \r\nAlthough it is not possible to supply a fully working copy of the site as static html, due to there being sections of the site that will not work standalone as static HTML (ie. the search). We could supply a copy of the HTML+PHP code that currently resides on the server if required. If this is required it will need to be requested prior to the decommissioning of the live BT servers (which I believe is the end of the year although could be as soon as the end of games). Another avenue is to spider the current website now, with an offline website scrapping application and/or talk to Akamai (who current cache the website) to see if they can supply a 'snapshot' of their cache. \r\n\r\n- \"Snapshots in time\" of the website \r\nWe could not be able to supply these, however waybackmachine/the internet archive has snapshots of the site back to the bid site in 2004 :-) \r\nIt may be worth speaking to these guys in terms of what you could do re. snapshots of the site? This would also cover the above requirement of a static copy of the site.\r\nhttp://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://www.london2012.com\r\n\r\nIn summary, all the content is available as XML, some (news, blogs) is highly structured and tagged other content is more freeform (and therefore may be harder to re-use in an automated way). The CMS and DB will be available to export from till the end of the year (but we are happy to keep it live longer, we just need to discuss timescales/costs if this is the case). There may be a modest cost in terms of us helping you manage the export (happy to give an estimate, but we should resume the conversation later this year). In terms of 'snapshots' or access to the site as it current stands (ie. as a complete website not in terms of content) you may be best to talk to the guys at Akamai or the internet archive (as they have already crawled and archived the site, including snapshots over time).\r\n\r\nHope that all helps, feel free to send over any other questions..\r\n\r\nIf I don't speak to you before have a great summer, enjoy the games and hopefully speak to you later in the year.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n","via_id":0,"attachments":[]}],"ticket_field_entries":[{"created_at":"2012/03/22 15:14:39

That seems tends to be the common way to handle GeoBlocking of videos (namely restrict the stream, rather than the code that retrieves the url/path to the stream).\n\nIn short I am not sure we need to be involved for TwoFour to geo-block a video, surely they just can restrict the stream based on the users IP? the request for the video will come from the users browser and hence their IP address (not ours).\n\nHope that makes sense...\n\nJamie","via_id":4,"attachments":[]}],"ticket_field_entries":[{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:49 +0100","ticket_field_id":95936,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:49 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 16:08:45 +0100","ticket_field_id":97116,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/04/30 13:27:29 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":110059,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":147056,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/05/02 16:43:39 +0100","value":"capped"},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":148059,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 16:08:45 +0100","ticket_field_id":177410,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/04/30 13:27:29 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 16:08:45 +0100","ticket_field_id":358835,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/04/30 13:27:29 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":361219,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":380790,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":381640,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":440663,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":486619,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 16:08:44 +0100","value":"1"}],"linkings":[]},{"assigned_at":"2012/04/20 16:00:51 +0100","assignee_id":3686603,"assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","base_score":20,"created_at":"2012/04/20 15:39:50 +0100","current_collaborators":null,"current_tags":"billable files images its","description":"Begin forwarded message:\n\n> From: Andy Watkins <Andy.Watkins@london2012.com>\n> Date: 20 April 2012 14:51:53 GMT+01:00\n> To: Jamie Unwin <jamie@kitsite.com>\n> Subject: RE: Updated TB Images\n> \n> Hi Jamie,\n>  \n> Just tried to call your mobile.

We’re not embedding them.\"\n\nYes, exactly (PDT/YL are not embeds). But they still have the old global footer on them (esp. YL) which we will need to suppress if the site/section is accessed via a non www domain ie. pdt.london2102.com (it's far to complex/ugly to make a completely new copy under a new domain and then edit that copy).\n\nAs an aside, I should clarify that if you go direct to youngleaders.london2102.com we will have to redirect you to youngleaders.london2102.com/young-leaders/ (youngleaders.london2102.com is simply an alias to www.london2102.com, not a new site). We will however limit access to specific directories for any request from the youngleaders.london2102.com subdomain (so that post switchover people can't browse the rest of the current site)\n\n\"For website checker, I would rather you get the ticket stuff deployed into that domain\". In the case of the website checker the domain is largely irrelevant for now, www. and ticketchecker. will both display that page in exactly the same way. There is no harm in D3 getting their surrounding page ready / getting the correct height for the iframe set etc. (and then changing the domain later on).\n\nOr are you worried about giving D3 two sets of instructions/breaking the task into two (and would rather just give it to them in one go). Either way, once the domain is pointing at the server and IPSoft have added a sever alias for that subdomain you should be able to access the www site with either domain. (ticketchecker.london2012.com will in effect simply be an alias for www.london2012.com - everything else site structure will be identical/as it is now).\n\nps. post switchover if someone access ticketchecker.london2102.com direct we should probably redirect them back to the 'surrounding' ticket checker page on the GTW site (which will then in turn load the embed content at http://ticketchecker.london2012.com/gtw/ticketing-website-checker.php into an iFrame).

It's not actually out Flash viewer, we've just embedded what was supplied by Haymarket.\n\nJamie","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":161948746,"created_at":"2012/04/26 17:56:58 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Hi Jamie,\n\nI’ll follow up tomorrow – and let you know what they saw when trying to access.\n\nThanks!\n\n","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":3686603,"created_at":"2012/04/30 13:17:13 +0100","is_public":false,"type":"Comment","value":"2 new logos and update of Events.classes with parner id's etc.  - 2 hrs\r\nlaunch of brochure - (semi contained in sepearte PO - ie. it dosn't cover the tiem spent, but is near enough not to raise another PO) ","via_id":0,"attachments":[]}],"ticket_field_entries":[{"created_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","ticket_field_id":95936,"ticket_id":228336947,"updated_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/04/25 19:06:25 +0100","ticket_field_id":97116,"ticket_id":228336947,"updated_at":"2012/04/30 13:17:13 +0100","value":"0.2"},{"created_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","ticket_field_id":110059,"ticket_id":228336947,"updated_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","ticket_field_id":147056,"ticket_id":228336947,"updated_at":"2012/04/30 13:17:33 +0100","value":"bill_to_festival"},{"created_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","ticket_field_id":148059,"ticket_id":228336947,"updated_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/04/25 19:06:24 +0100","ticket_field_id":177410,"ticket_id":228336947,"updated_at":"2012/04/25 19:06:24 +0100","value":"0.2"},{"created_at":"2012/04/25 19:06:25 +0100","ticket_field_id":358835,"ticket_id":228336947,"updated_at":"2012/04/30 13:17:13 +0100","value":"0.2"},{"created_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","ticket_field_id":361219,"ticket_id":228336947,"updated_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","ticket_field_id":380790,"ticket_id":228336947,"updated_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","ticket_field_id":381640,"ticket_id":228336947,"updated_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","ticket_field_id":440663,"ticket_id":228336947,"updated_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","ticket_field_id":486619,"ticket_id":228336947,"updated_at":"2012/04/25 15:49:49 +0100","value":"0"}],"linkings":[]}]
