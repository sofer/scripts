Synchronising the log files across all servers is obviously pointless and destructive - as well as being time and bandwidth-consuming.\r\n\r\nThe synchronisation of web01-06 is outside of Kitsite's control but I would like to present the following two options for fixing this issue:\r\n\r\n 1. Request that ipsoft amend the synchronisation process such that /apps/apache/logs is excluded from the synchronisation process. Kitsite would then amend the apache config across all 6 servers (plus the two staging servers) in order to write logs to the new location.\r\n\r\n 2. Kitsite amend the servers web01-06 such that \"/etc/httpd/logs\" is symlinked to a new folder, named /apps/logs/apache (note that it's NOT in /apps/apache and is thus excluded from the synchronisation process). The logs will carry on being rotated - as at present - by linux's \"logrotate\" subsystem. No change to apache config (or downtime) necessary.\r\n\r\nI can only provide an estimate for (2.) which would be up to one day (although hopefully closer to 1/2 day).\r\n\r\nKieran\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2011/07/28 14:25:23 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Here is the response from IPsoft on this - \r\n\r\nIt appears that Kitsite have changed the apache log location (3rd June) on all 6 london2012 web-servers but there are a few inconsistencies.\r\nWe’ve been escalating a problem we picked-up with AWstats because it broke but we haven’t had a response back about it yet (probably because there’s a lack of understanding and my engineers haven’t been making it clear)\r\n\r\nThe position we’re in as detailed below means the following:\r\n\r\n•\tThe log location is not the same on all servers (exception is web06 which hasn’t been changed)\r\n•\tThere is no log rotation on web05 (it has been removed)\r\n•\tThe log location has been shifted to /var/log/httpd/ - the root file system.
