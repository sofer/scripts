I had planned to cross check these fields with the column headers on the exported excel document but I didn’t have time today and I’m not in the office tomorrow.\n\nAnyway, listed below are the fields that we ask for when they register and these should correspond to the data which we export in terms of column headers.\n\nThankyou!\n\nName of the event\nAbout the event\nWe will be celebrating by....

We will develop a conversation gadget for the london2012.com page, allowing  users to send status updates via Facebook and Twitter, and see all of the updates being sent by everyone else on the channel.\r\n\r\n\"We will also look to incorporate social plugins where possible as per below alongside the conversation gadget.  \r\n• Adding the like button will allow for users on the site to ‘like’ videos or the ‘like’ the page itself and help drive  visitor traffic  \r\n• Comments (user commenting on the videos from the athletes) \r\n• Send – to share messages and content out to friends  \r\n\r\n\"In summary, the proposal is to aggregate Twitter and YouTube content to a central data store where it can be moderated before being made available as part of the data feed to the visualisation components.  The data services for the visualisation layer would be requested from the London 2012 site and cached there in order to minimise the scaling requirements for the aggregation layer. \r\n\r\n\"Twitter content is best harvested using a stream client with filters for the #londoncalling and various likely  misspellings.  This would be written in Python and run as a persistent process on the aggregation services hosting (described below).  All twitter data would be stored locally and processed into the database, with categorisation such as hashflag and geo code identification applied at this point. \r\n\r\n\"The data required by the visualisation component would be provided as a JSON feed, as well as pre-formatted HTML content (for listings and to support accessible versions of the content).\r\n\r\n\"The aggregation service will be performing limited operations in processing the incoming Twitter and YouTube  feeds and supporting the moderation users and cached requests from the Olympics site.  It is therefore anticipated  that a single cloud server instance would be sufficient to provide this service. \r\n\r\n\"The proposed integration process is that the London 2012 site requests data from the aggregation service and  caches it locally in order to support requests from the visualisation components in use by the public audience.  This will require minimal integration effort on behalf of the site provider.  All other files will be served as static. \"\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/06/13 12:39:03 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"This looks like it could be a serious pain in the arse especially if BT/CTS decide to interpret the requirement for a \"single cloud server instance\" as a new virtual host on web01-6.","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/06/14 12:52:36 +0100","attachments":[{"size":2274686,"created_at":"2011/06/14 12:50:53 +0100","content_type":"application/pdf","token":"rw1sg3i68itxjy1","id":49935442,"filename":"2012-OneYearToGo_UX_v1.pdf","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/rw1sg3i68itxjy1/?name=2012-OneYearToGo_UX_v1.pdf"}],"via_id":0,"value":"From Pj Jones at Collective:\r\n\r\nWe’re working on the London’s Calling project for LOCOG and this will be integrated into the london2012.com architecture.

If there's anything in my description that you'd prefer was done differently, let me know and we can try and make it fit.\r\n\r\nWe'd like a page just like the map at http://www.london2012.com/map.php in which there'll be a small chunk of HTML in the body similar to the following: \r\n\r\n<div id=\"oytg-container-2012\">\r\n<div id=\"oytg-container\">\r\n<div id=\"oytg-top\">\r\n<h2>Cant see the content?</h2>\r\n<p>The application requires<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash&amp;promoid=BIOW\">flash player version 10 or higher</a>and a JavaScript enabled browser.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"oytg-bottom\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThen in the head of the page, we'll have a javascript URL for you to include, which will have a method listening for document-ready that inserts the Flash into the top section, and fetches some HTML content for the bottom section, along with a stylesheet.\r\n\r\nAs you have jquery and swfobject included in pages anyway, we'll make use of those.\r\nFor communication between the Flash and the rest of the page, we'll need to make something global, so I suggest we use 'OYTG' for this, which shouldn't interfere with anything else in the page.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in the CSS, we'll be targeting everything as \"#oytg-container ___\".\r\n\r\nOnce the page has loaded, there will be calls made to fetch new HTML content specific to individual countries, as well as a periodic call to update the grand totals.\r\n\r\nWe're using Twitter's @Anywhere javascript library for the post functionality. We'll insert the script tag for this into the document dynamically. When visitors click 'Submit', a popup served from Twitter appears asking for permission and then after a choice is made, the popup redirects back to the page that opened it. The @Anywhere javascript, as soon as it loads, then closes the popup, and triggers a callback in the main page.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/06/24 12:29:32 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Required width of #oytg-container-2012 is 990px.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/06/30 14:58:14 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"From Pj at Collective:\r\n\r\nYou should be able to test it now by adding the tags below before the </head> tag.

The new graphic is attached. Is it best to create a couple of duplicate templates with the slightly different logo, so that we can create pages using it? It would be the normal content template we need replicating - http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/volunteer/diversity-and-inclusion/ - plus the sub-hub template with promos - http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/volunteer/games-maker-roles-and-venues/\n\nI'm sorry the timeline on this is tight - we'd need the templates ready for population by the end of Thursday at the latest.
