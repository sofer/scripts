In short the problem / solution is not clear cut - with many people arguing that what we are doing is correct and the parser / validator is wrong]\n\nJamie\n\n1) Frame titles\n\n- We have added a title to the eDialog iFrame [ title=\"Signup form\" ]\n\n- But the Google+ iframe is actually written out by Google we just load a script which then rewrite the tags below into the iFrame that Ability.net are seeing.\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js\"><\/script> \n<g:plusone size=\"medium\"></g:plusone>\n\nWe therefore have no control of the iFrame code that Google writes into the page. \n\n2a) Parsing errors - Doubleclick\n\nThese are due to the Doubleclick tags? Not out writing out of them? We can remove the hspace=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" but need to check with Erin/Doubleclick/Google if this will cause issues.\n\n- Line 27, Column 251: there is no attribute \"hspace\"\n…ginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scroll…\n\nLine 32, Column 125: required attribute \"alt\" not specified\n…gs_settings;sz=728x90;tile=1;lang=en;ord=1316513423?' width='728' height='90'/>\n\n2b) Parsing errors - Google +1\n\nThis is because Google are using their own tag <g:plusone> into the page.\n\n[This is a very well known, documented and discussed issue, the problem / solution is not clear cut - with many arguing that what we are doing is correct and the parser / validator is wrong]\n\nLine 67, Column 172: there is no attribute \"size\"\n…/plusone.js\"><\/script><g:plusone size=\"medium\"></g:plusone></li><li id=\"so-fac…\n\nLine 67, Column 180: element \"g:plusone\" undefined\n….js\"><\/script><g:plusone size=\"medium\"></g:plusone></li><li id=\"so-facebook\"><…\n\nThis issue is documented here:\nhttp://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Webmasters/thread?tid=51eb2ff3e340bc76&hl=en\n\nThere are people suggesting using a <div> tag instead of the <g:plusone> but we'd need to investigate further if this will cause other issues, the code Tom supplied was in the <g:plusone> format and that is the format Google suggest is used.\n\n2c) Parsing errors - Facebook\n\nThis is a very similar issue to above, namely Facebook specific tags <fb:like/> which the W3C doesnt' like as is doesn't know about them.\n\n[Once again this is a very well known, documented and discussed issue, the problem / solution is not clear cut - with many arguing that what we are doing is correct and the parser / validator is wrong]\n\nLine 67, Column 379: there is no attribute \"href\"\n…4&amp;xfbml=1\"><\/script><fb:like href=\"https://www.facebook.com/London2012\" se…\n\nThe correct solution here, which we have previously implemented (although I think we took out in the ned) is to add a namespace attribute to the page so that the <fb:> and <g:> tags are not part of the document, but the W3C validator seems to ignore the namespace declaration. Kieran spent quite an amount of time investigating this a few weeks back when we added the Google +1 tags. It may be best if II let him explain direct (to you or whoever need to know).\n\n3) Non-text content [ref: 1.1.1] – LOCOG logo needs descriptive\n\nThe site says \"LOCOG logo\" across the site it always has, ironically I think we were previously told to use \"LOCOG logo\" as it was descriptive of the image (along the acronym LOOCG probably isn't that obvious).\n\nIf you want we could change it, but I don't think we should change it only in one place? hence we'll need to bulk republish the site, this is unrelated to the e-signup pages specifically.\n\nIs changing this a priority for launching eDialog?\n\n4) Focus visible [ref: 2.4.7] – Three Stylesheet links show no focus indicator\n\nThis is common to the whole site, I am not sure this has ever been an issue before / it was never in the designs. \n\nOnce again this is a moderately significant site wide change, unrelated to the e-signup pages specifically, I think we probably need to agree what this wil look like . check it cross browser first before rolling it out.\n\nIs changing this a priority for launching eDialog?","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/09/20 12:26:40 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"See http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/5012 \"the 2012 home page doesn't validate\" raised by Kieran a couple of weeks ago.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/09/23 11:34:17 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Danny,\r\n\r\nNeed to be careful with this ticket / what it contains, there is a multitude of tasks that may or not be getting tracked correctly, there may be other tickets that cover a sub set of these tasks.\r\n\r\n- The actual dev work work on the e-dialog page [7 days]\r\n- The in initial / additional conference calls / investigation / correspondence with LOCOG / e-dialog over the above [3 days, so far]\r\n- The modification of the login links (to signup) plus any redirects in preparation of the switch over [0.5 days]\r\n- The disabling of commenting and photo upload [0.5 days]\r\n- The deployment of any code / switch over [to do]\r\n- The rewriting of blog commenting / photo upload (these should be, and I think are separate tickets?)\r\n- Ability.net changes re. parse errors with Facebook, Google + and double click [so far 0.5 day, ongoing..]\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/10/06 12:01:48 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"New tickets opened: #4284 and #4285.

I am sure we coudl recode this and put the height/width or padding on a wrapper <div> but this is not the sort of whim we want to make on a whim as it could cause issues elsewhere on the site.\n\nWhy we are using a <h3> I am not sure, it's not something we would do, but I expect CogApp had a reason for doing so. As mentioned above we can look at recoding, but not without taking time to look at why it is coded like that and what are implications of recoding it. \n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/09/26 11:40:20 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hey, soz if I was unclear, wasn’t suggesting you make them now :-) Fine to do it at your own pace if that can be sometime this week?\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3734551},{"created_at":"2011/09/26 11:46:47 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"I expect the first will be fairly easy to address, the second more tricky.\n\nAlthough the first seems like a major oversight (excuse the pun) / embarrassment, when advertising a blind sport even so will try and get that one looked at with the highest priority (ie. today).\n\nThe second, while not technically correct, I expect won't actually cause anyone serious issues in terms of navigating the site on a screen reader - although will look into that as well, but probably not till later on in the week.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/09/26 12:19:00 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Much appreciated\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3734551},{"created_at":"2011/09/27 14:06:17 +0100","attachments":[{"size":87299,"created_at":"2011/09/27 13:54:17 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"aeveofzmmedabug","id":68903097,"filename":"edit-title.png","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/aeveofzmmedabug/?name=edit-title.png"},{"size":306070,"created_at":"2011/09/27 14:00:37 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"kqkxtkuexmnmkgy","id":68904457,"filename":"title-as-div.png","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/kqkxtkuexmnmkgy/?name=title-as-div.png"},{"size":255473,"created_at":"2011/09/27 14:00:50 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"par8nhx13c977xn","id":67077408,"filename":"title-as-h1.png","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/par8nhx13c977xn/?name=title-as-h1.png"},{"size":155707,"created_at":"2011/09/27 14:00:57 +0100","content_type":"image/png","token":"jprhhggltmmgixc","id":68904527,"filename":"two-h1-tags-on-news-page.png","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/jprhhggltmmgixc/?name=two-h1-tags-on-news-page.png"}],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi Finn,\r\n\r\nI have updated the logo with alternative text (you can actually do this yourself by editing the relevant header component in <sport>/includes/header) [see attached screen shot 1]. \r\n\r\nhttps://londonprepares.kitsite.com/kit/pages/edit/goalball/includes/header.html\r\n\r\nI have only updated Goalball, will leave you to check/amend the others.\r\n\r\nIn terms of turning it from a <div> tag into a <h1> tags I did actually do this [see attached screen shot 2 and 3 for before and after]. \r\n\r\nBut....\r\n\r\n Then noticed this has a unwanted side effect on the news pages as they already have a <h1> tag, so we now have two [see attached screen shot 4]. \r\n\r\nWe can't just change the <h1> into a <h2> as we already have different styles applied to the <h2> additional we shouldn't have two <h1> tags as when Google see's two <h1> tags there is evidence that it discards both and just uses the page title.\r\n\r\nFurthermore because the header component is a shared include and  doesn't know about the page it is included in, we can't conditionally write out different tags depending on the page.\r\n\r\nI have therefore reverted the image header back into a <div>, although it now does now have the fallback text.\r\n\r\nAm yet to look at the footer.\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/09/27 14:13:38 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Cool, thanks Jamie.

Also, are you able to find out how many people went to the page when it was live yesterday (both times)?\n\nThanks\n\nDeb\n\nFrom: Jo Hemmant\nSent: 27 September 2011 09:46\nTo: Susannah Cooper\nCc: Ben Matthews; Claire Hutchinson\nSubject: FW: Globe to Globe press embargo\n\nHi Susannah\nCan you help with any of Nigel's questions please?\nMany thanks\nJo\n\nFrom: Nigel Hinds\nSent: 26 September 2011 20:24\nTo: Ben Matthews; Jo Hemmant\nCc: Claire Hutchinson; Paul Woodmansey\nSubject: Globe to Globe press embargo\n\nDear Ben and Jo\n\nI have a meeting with Dominic Dromgoole at 10am on Weds morning, and expect to get my ear heavily bent about our website having broken the press embargo.\n\nBy the end of tomorrow, please could you find out for me as much of the following as possible:\n\n *   When the link first went live?\n\n *   What time it came down the first time? *\n\n *   What time it went live the second time?\n\n *   What time it came down the second time? *\n\n *   How come it went live in the first place?\n\n *   What was the blip that made it go live the second time?\n\n *   Any data we have on the number of page visits (as close to 0 as possible, I hope)\n\n *   Any other info we have on the extent of the impact of the breach\n\n *   How can we stop it happening again?\n\n(*  I have a note of these through my emails, but it would be good to have them all on one note.)\n\n\n\nThanks, both.\n\n\n\nBest wishes\n\n\n\n    Nigel\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

This is usually very straight-forward but for news and blog pages it isn't, because the workflow is non-standard (see http://postcms.zendesk.com/entries/20480623-removing-news-and-blogs-from-the-site).\r\n\r\nWe were eventually able to put it back into a 'Draft' state, which meant that it wasn't being linked to from the front page, but to do this we had to bypass the usual workflows, so that the page was not actually deleted form the site.\r\n\r\nJamie has I think already looked at google analytics and it would appear that the page was accessed a few times in the late-afternoon. This is likely to have been when the page was inadvertently not just published on the site but linked to from other parts of the site.\r\n\r\nOnce we removed these links after around 6pm, the traffic appears to have died down from a handful of visits to nothing and even though the page was still on the site and theoretically visible, it was not being accessed, because there was no way to navigate to it from any other part of the site.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the tale is probably that if an embargoed news story (or blog entry) is mistakenly published and then expired, it is a mistake to attempt to recover it by bypassing the usual workflows. Instead, it is almost certainly easier to just create a new version of the page and re-enter the copy.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/09/28 08:53:30 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"thanks Danny.

The filename in the XML also doesn't take into account of the edge cases where the file is sent more than once (see below for details).
