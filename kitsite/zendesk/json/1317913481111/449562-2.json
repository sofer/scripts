All others in the CMS have this ad tag.\n\nThat's the tag the page has already? (view the page source)\nvar tags='pgs_get-involved_volunteer/young-games-makers'\n\nI have mentioned this already to Erin, but probably worth re-iterating, the tags are *auto-generated* based on the section hierarchy in the CMS.\n\nWe have added in some special rules for keys sections ie. news/blogs/photos and the games/venue sections.\n\nBut there really is no notion of changing a tag on an individual page (we did do this for a BP/Arts page, but that was meant to be no more than a stop gap until we modified the CMS to allow you to assign/override the tag on a specific page). We can't continue to add 'per page' executions into the code base, we really need to keep it clean and limited to outputting tag from the standard logic or else we'll just end up with problems down the road.\n\nIn terms of tags that look wrong, if something looks wildly out then let us know (for example the year folder inside the photos sections meant that the standard logic for generating tags need to be slightly altered for those sections. But in general, the tags that are generated in the CMS should drive the DFP tags, rather than the other way round (as we don't have a config file where we can easily say these page or section get these tags).\n\nHope that makes sense\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/09/21 14:05:48 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Section is now republishing.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603}],"organization_id":38711,"field_177410":"0.1","assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3686603},{"nice_id":5154,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/09/21 11:44:07 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:54 +0100","problem_id":null,"resolution_time":1,"priority_id":0,"current_tags":"authorized cms its level_0 none_required not_billable tested upload","assignee_id":3686603,"updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:40 +0100","req_name":"Uzma.Khan","ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:40 +0100","solved_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:40 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"not_billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/09/21 11:44:07 +0100","permissions":{},"score":8,"via_id":4,"subject":"Publucation - error","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"not_billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"authorized"},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:39 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 11:45:40 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/21 10:49:56 +0100","ticket_id":116898091,"value":"0"}],"channel":null,"submitter_id":8189631,"base_score":8,"linkings":[],"latest_recipients":"jamie@kitsite.com support+id1DFV-2DBS@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":"Jamie Unwin","status_id":3,"description":"PROTECT \n\n\nHi Guys \n\n \n\nI have been uploading some publications into the CMS but every time I\ntry to preview them I get the screen below - can you look into thanks.\nLet me know if I have upload them again. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUzma,\n\n \n\nUzma Khan\n\nMarketing Assistant (New Media)\n\nCommunications  \n\nDirect line: 020 3023 6927\n\n \n\nOlympic Delivery Authority\n\nMailpoint: 7a\n\n23rd Floor, One Churchill Place\n\nLondon E14 5LN\n\n \n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\n\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\n\nwww.london2012.com <http://www.london2012.com/> \n\n \n\nFind out what is going on at London 2012 HQ - http://blog.london2012.com\n<http://blog.london2012.com/> \n\n \n\n \n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email\n\n \n\n\nInformation owned by ODA\n\nPlease delete if you are not the intended recipient\n\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">This email and any attachments are for the attention of the addressee(s) only.\nIt may also be confidential.

My comments below:\n\nIntro text – there needs to be some fuller text here; will chase for this and forward asap.\n\nGeneral – on the spreadsheet with the data fields there is a column for ‘Associated text’ with some important information e.g. ‘Family name must be as it appears on your identification document’ etc. Is the best way to do this as tooltips using the ‘i’ icon we originally had for phase 1? These explanatory notes are important, as some of the fields they are asking for don’t make sense on their own\n\nSentence case for all field labels i.e. ‘Family name’ rather than ‘Family Name’ and ‘Preferred given name’ rather than ‘Preferred Given name’\n\nGender – the values requested by Ceremonies are ‘M=Male, F=Female’. I think therefore they want ‘M’ and ‘F’ rather than the full forms, and they want to remove the ‘Prefer not to say’ value from Phase 1. Is that a problem if you are pulling in data from Phase 1 and the applicant has only given ‘Prefer not to say’?\n\nIdentification type – apostrophe missing in ‘UK Driver’s Licence’\n\nID – I am pondering whether there is in fact an ID number on a birth certificate – surely not? I will check with Ceremonies whether this is in fact possible.\n\nCountry of issue for ID and Country of birth – dropdown isn’t wide enough for some of the values e.g. ‘United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ – do we need this full version of the UK (did Campbell mandate this country list?) or could we just have ‘United Kingdom’?\n\nConfirm email address field – this wasn’t on the original datasheet; also, won’t the email field be prepopulated from phase 1 (unless we are offering people the option to change the value?)\n\nBackground check – tweak question ‘Do you consent to background check?’ to ‘Do you consent to a background check?’\n\nDeclaration on Unspent Convictions – this doesn’t make sense grammatically or legally or whatever it’s supposed to do. I will check with Ceremonies team what it’s supposed to be....\n\n‘Do you have any accessibility requirements in order to undergo the audition process’ – missing a question mark\n\n‘If you answered yes to the above question, which of the above do you require?’ – please change to ‘If you answered yes to the above question, which of the above apply to you?’\n\n‘In the event of you being cast as a Ceremonies Volunteer Performer. Do you have any dietary requirements’ – please change to ‘In the event of you being cast as a Ceremonies Volunteer Performer, do you have any dietary requirements?’\n\n‘We are interested in whether you have any specific performance skills?’ – please change to ‘We are interested in whether you have any specific performance skills. Please check all which apply.’\n\nValues for skills – please make these sentence case e.g. ‘Circus skills’\n\nTypo in ‘Parrellel Skating’ – change to ‘Parallel skating’\n\nReminder on length of committement and compulsary dates – can we have the checkbox at the bottom of this statement rather than at the top?. Also two typos – should be ‘Reminder on length of commitment and compulsory dates’\n\nTerms and conditions – we need to link to these (open in a new window) at https://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/terms-and-conditions.php\n\n‘By submitting this form, and having read the FAQs [insert hyperlink to relevant FAQ]....’ - replace text in square brackets with link from ‘FAQs’ to https://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/faqs.php\n\nLink to Diversity and Inclusion Form<https://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/> – this needs to be removed from the actual sign-up form and should be displayed on the confirmation screen after the thank you message – it should link to the page http://survey.london2012.com/survey/386255/125c/ (I am still building this page, so ignore the resemblance to the Torch Relay D&I form)\n\nI tried to submit the form but got an error message ‘Sorry, there was an error processing your request. Please report this.’\n\nThank you message – change to ‘Thank you. Your details have been received and we will be in touch in the near future with confirmation of your audition details including date, time and venue.’\nWhen you say “The link, above, is for MY ceremonies signup, and I suggest you use it for testing as it allows you to return and re-edit your details EVEN IF you've already filled in and saved your details” – is this expected behaviour? I was expecting that the link would only work once – is it a security risk to allow people to access submitted data (if the link gets shared, for example)?\n\nI will chase Campbell re: his audition dates api – sorry you haven’t had it before now. Are you waiting for other things from him?\n\nPhew, that’s a lot. Happy to chat through these. Do you think by the end of the day most of these changes will be in place? Keen to share with the Ceremonies team so they can test.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nMorag\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2011/09/07 10:12:57 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi Morag, I'm working through these.

Intro text – there needs to be some fuller text here; will chase for this and forward asap.\r\nYou are able to edit this yourself:\r\n  https://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/pages/edit/games/ceremonies/get-involved/ceremonies-application-stage-two.php\r\n\r\n> 2. General – on the spreadsheet with the data fields there is a column for ‘Associated text’ with some important information e.g. ‘Family name must be as it appears on your identification document’ etc. Is the best way to do this as tooltips using the ‘i’ icon we originally had for phase 1? These explanatory notes are important, as some of the fields they are asking for don’t make sense on their own\r\nThe only piece of explanatory text that I see on the original is below the UK postcode box.\r\n https://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/ceremonies-application.php\r\nand I don't see any (i) icons. Did they get removed at some stage?\r\n\r\n> 3. Sentence case for all field labels i.e. ‘Family name’ rather than ‘Family Name’ and ‘Preferred given name’ rather than ‘Preferred Given name’\r\nAgree entirely - was (rather naively) following what was supplied!\r\n\r\n> 4. Gender – the values requested by Ceremonies are ‘M=Male, F=Female’. I think therefore they want ‘M’ and ‘F’ rather than the full forms, and they want to remove the ‘Prefer not to say’ value from Phase 1. Is that a problem if you are pulling in data from Phase 1 and the applicant has only given ‘Prefer not to say’?\r\nAre you saying that they want \"M\" to appear in the dropdown?\r\nI have made this change. However, I should flag it as being less usable than Male/Female. \r\n\r\n\r\n> 5. Identification type – apostrophe missing in ‘UK Driver’s Licence’\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> 6. ID – I am pondering whether there is in fact an ID number on a birth certificate – surely not? I will check with Ceremonies whether this is in fact possible.\r\nFurthermore, I doubt there is an expiry date on a (UK) Birth Cert, either!\r\n\r\n> 7. Country of issue for ID and Country of birth – dropdown isn’t wide enough for some of the values e.g. ‘United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ – do we need this full version of the UK (did Campbell mandate this country list?) or could we just have ‘United Kingdom’?\r\n\r\nI'm using the same list as is used for the YGM form.\r\nI agree that it is unusable (Lars struggled to find Germany under \"Federal Republic of Germany\" and if anyone from Uruguay manages to find \"Eastern Republic of Uruguay\" then I would surprised!). \r\nI am happy to work with whatever list is required, if Campbell can advise.\r\n\r\n> 8. Confirm email address field – this wasn’t on the original datasheet; also, won’t the email field be prepopulated from phase 1 (unless we are offering people the option to change the value?)\r\nOk. Removed (well, \"hidden\").\r\n\r\n> 9. Background check – tweak question ‘Do you consent to background check?’ to ‘Do you consent to a background check?’\r\n\r\n> 10. Declaration on Unspent Convictions – this doesn’t make sense grammatically or legally or whatever it’s supposed to do. I will check with Ceremonies team what it’s supposed to be....\r\nAgree! Thanks.\r\n\r\n> 11. ‘Do you have any accessibility requirements in order to undergo the audition process’ – missing a question mark\r\nDone\r\n\r\n> 12. ‘If you answered yes to the above question, which of the above do you require?’ – please change to ‘If you answered yes to the above question, which of the above apply to you?’\r\nDone, although I used my initiative and changed \"above\" to \"below\"!\r\n\r\n> 13. ‘In the event of you being cast as a Ceremonies Volunteer Performer. Do you have any dietary requirements’ – please change to ‘In the event of you being cast as a Ceremonies Volunteer Performer, do you have any dietary requirements?’\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> 14. ‘We are interested in whether you have any specific performance skills?’ – please change to ‘We are interested in whether you have any specific performance skills. Please check all which apply.’\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> 15. Values for skills – please make these sentence case e.g. ‘Circus skills’\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> 16. Typo in ‘Parrellel Skating’ – change to ‘Parallel skating’\r\nHmm, I even noticed that myself but forgot to fix!\r\n\r\n> 17. Reminder on length of committement and compulsary dates – can we have the checkbox at the bottom of this statement rather than at the top?. Also two typos – should be ‘Reminder on length of commitment and compulsory dates’\r\nAlignment is a little tricky. I will need to get Lars to look at this (but not right now as he's tied up with YGM form). \r\n\r\n> 18. Terms and conditions – we need to link to these (open in a new window) at https://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/terms-and-conditions.php\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> 19. ‘By submitting this form, and having read the FAQs [insert hyperlink to relevant FAQ]....’ - replace text in square brackets with link from ‘FAQs’ to https://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/faqs.php\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> 20. Link to Diversity and Inclusion Form<https://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/> – this needs to be removed from the actual sign-up form and should be displayed on the confirmation screen after the thank you message – it should link to the page http://survey.london2012.com/survey/386255/125c/ (I am still building this page, so ignore the resemblance to the Torch Relay D&I form)\r\nRemoved.\r\n\r\n            <div><a href=\"#\">Link to Diversity and Inclusion Form</a></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n> 21. I tried to submit the form but got an error message ‘Sorry, there was an error processing your request. Please report this.’\r\nThat is obviously not expected behaviour. Are you able to reproduce?\r\n\r\n> 22. Thank you message – change to ‘Thank you. Your details have been received and we will be in touch in the near future with confirmation of your audition details including date, time and venue.’\r\nJust so that I'm straight, you got an error the first time (21.) but no error the second time?\r\nAs per (1.) you are able to edit this text yourself, here:\r\n  https://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/pages/edit/games/ceremonies/get-involved/ceremonies-application-stage-two.php\r\n\r\n> 23. When you say “The link, above, is for MY ceremonies signup, and I suggest you use it for testing as it allows you to return and re-edit your details EVEN IF you've already filled in and saved your details” – is this expected behaviour? I was expecting that the link would only work once – is it a security risk to allow people to access submitted data (if the link gets shared, for example)?\r\nI mean that the link I supplied you is for kieran@kitsite.com. I have added some special-case processing so that kieran@kitsite.com IS allowed to return and edit his data (otherwise this testing that we're doing right now would be very cumbersome!)\r\n\r\n> 24. I will chase Campbell re: his audition dates api – sorry you haven’t had it before now. Are you waiting for other things from him?\r\nIt has been promised a number of times now. Most recently \"by yesterday evening\". I'm very keen to test against it ASAP, as there were differences even between the sample and the more detailed example.\r\n\r\n> Thank you so much!\r\nNot at all!\r\n\r\nKieran\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2011/09/07 11:34:56 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"ITEMS REQUIRING MY/YOUR INPUT\r\n\r\nC1.

Occasionally, of course, mistakes happen.\r\nTo ensure such mistakes don't cause broken css to appear on the live site, we should add a workflow trigger that runs whenever you click \"publish\" on a css asset.\r\nThis trigger should validate the css against the live w3c validator:\r\n http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/api.html\r\nusing SOAP.\r\nIf any errors are found, an error should be raised, and the asset should NOT be published.\r\nOn the rare occasions when the validator is down, or if you really really want to publish some syntactically incorrect css, then you can manually amend the workflow, temporarily disabling the check.\r\nEstimate: 1 days work.\r\n\r\nPHP. It is similarly possible to mistakenly write template/container code which generates syntactically incorrect php code. We should amend the publication engine such that it runs \"php -l\" against each php file that it uploads, and refuses to upload any malformed php. This should be configurable via the publication target settings (\"validate_php?\").\r\nEstimate: 1 days work.\r\n\r\nAllowing for contingency, the above will probably take up to three days of my time.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926}],"organization_id":38711,"field_177410":"0","assignee_name":"Danny Sofer","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":3640926},{"nice_id":599,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/02/23 11:49:36 +0000","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/02/23 11:49:36 +0000","problem_id":null,"resolution_time":13655,"priority_id":2,"current_tags":"level_0 none_required","assignee_id":3640926,"updated_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","req_name":"Jamie Unwin","ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","solved_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2010/03/08 15:21:21 +0000","permissions":{},"score":20,"via_id":0,"subject":"Failed sports includes?","recipient":null,"organization_name":"Kitsite","group_id":61946,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","ticket_id":8178019,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/02/23 11:49:36 +0000","updated_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","ticket_id":8178019,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","ticket_id":8178019,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","ticket_id":8178019,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","ticket_id":8178019,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/02/23 11:49:36 +0000","updated_at":"2010/02/23 11:49:36 +0000","ticket_id":8178019,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","ticket_id":8178019,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","ticket_id":8178019,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","ticket_id":8178019,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","ticket_id":8178019,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","ticket_id":8178019,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/15 11:22:55 +0100","ticket_id":8178019,"value":"0"}],"channel":null,"submitter_id":3686603,"base_score":20,"linkings":[],"latest_recipients":null,"due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"status_id":3,"description":"[Tue Feb 23 11:46:48 2010] [error] [client 94.101.164.1] PHP Warning:  include(games/olympic-sports/people/cycling-bmx.php) [<a href='function.include'>function.include</a>]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /apps/apache/html/new.london2012.com/games/olympic-sports/cycling-bmx.php on line 160, referer: http://www.london2012.com/games/index.php\r\n\r\n[Tue Feb 23 11:46:48 2010] [error] [client 94.101.164.1] PHP Warning:  include() [<a href='function.include'>function.include</a>]: Failed opening 'games/olympic-sports/people/cycling-bmx.php' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/share/pear') in /apps/apache/html/new.london2012.com/games/olympic-sports/cycling-bmx.php on line 160, referer: http://www.london2012.com/games/index.php\r\n","comments":[{"created_at":"2010/02/23 11:49:36 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"[Tue Feb 23 11:46:48 2010] [error] [client 94.101.164.1] PHP Warning:  include(games/olympic-sports/people/cycling-bmx.php) [<a href='function.include'>function.include</a>]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /apps/apache/html/new.london2012.com/games/olympic-sports/cycling-bmx.php on line 160, referer: http://www.london2012.com/games/index.php\r\n\r\n[Tue Feb 23 11:46:48 2010] [error] [client 94.101.164.1] PHP Warning:  include() [<a href='function.include'>function.include</a>]: Failed opening 'games/olympic-sports/people/cycling-bmx.php' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/share/pear') in /apps/apache/html/new.london2012.com/games/olympic-sports/cycling-bmx.php on line 160, referer: http://www.london2012.com/games/index.php\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2010/03/08 15:37:18 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"This is happening when a sport page does not use a 'people' include.

(just read your final line) \"Can we make the splash the entry point through the global nav, but not have it in the left hand nav when you are in the section? \"\n\nThis is *really* tricky as that navigation is completely encapsulated/logic based, will really have to have a hard think about how to do this / what is involved and do some experimenting on dev, it's not going to be simple and changing that nav will need proper testing as it effects the whole site.\n\nAlso \"and can we make the hub page the main 'II home' in the left hand nav?\"\n\nThat may be the simpler solution? Keep the navigation as it is (ie. splash page is not the index, it's just splash.php) and then just link direct to the splash page internally (when you want to) and/or setup a short url that takes users direct to the splash page if you send links in a mail out. \n\nMessing with that left hand nav in haste is probably not a great idea, it may be that (medium term) we could code a more generic solution that dealt with this situation, ie. allowed a Splash page to be used as to level page in a section. But as I said this will need some though. Another solution is we do something clever with cookies so that the user gets automatically redirected form the splash to the hub one they have seen that page (probably my preferred solution as it's more isolated than changing the local nav component).\n\nIf it helps you make a decision we won't be able to recode that left hand nav or do anything with cookies this week, \n\nSo it will either have to stay as it it is (ie. the top level link always goes to the splash) or we keep it as it was previously and just link internally (from promos, text) to the splash page and direct people external users to it via a short url\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/01/27 16:34:12 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Thanks for this, Jamie.\nI agree with your second solution: “Keep the navigation as it is (ie. splash page is not the index, it's just splash.php) and then just link direct to the splash page internally (when you want to) and/or setup a short url that takes users direct to the splash page if you send links in a mail out.”\n\nAre you able to make this change and let me know when I can publish it out?\n\nMany thanks!\n\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2011/01/27 16:35:50 +0000","attachments":[{"size":573371,"created_at":"2011/01/27 16:35:50 +0000","content_type":"image/png","token":"jsbwodtcwyuno2k","id":15829285,"filename":"image001.png","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/jsbwodtcwyuno2k/?name=image001.png"}],"via_id":4,"value":"PS Don’t suppose we could make the left-hand nav in Get involved > Education go to the International Inspiration section?\n\ni.e. the link highlighted in the grab below takes you via the splash page?

The important think to realise is that each page doesn't have it's own navigation HTML; there is no International Inspiration local nav (as an individual component) it's just some global logic that builds the nav depending on rules (news and blogs do have their own nav; but these are totally different and date based). I'm slightly loath to go down this route as there is a real danger of it leading to add behaviour which we spend days after the change tidying up.\n\n* I think you are thinking of cookie vs IP based \"sessions\" which is something a bit different, because you can only fit so much info in a cookie (~128 characters) the web-server stores some information on the server [ie. login name etc] gives that store of information (the session) an ID and then stores that 'session ID' in a cookie on the user browser so that on subsequent pages it can get the session id and then find any info stored for that ID locally on the server. The problem is because we have 6 server and no central session storage, we need to make sure that the user always goes back to the same server or else the information in the 'session' (stored on the server) won't exist. We used to do this based on IP ie. all users from a given IP address always got returned to the same server but post Akamai we had to do this with cookies (as all request appear to the load balancer to come from Akamaki; not sure that is entirely true, but that was the reason I was given). btw. this is that problem of why sometimes it appears as if you are logged out when you are logged in when using https (basically you get sent randomly to different servers each time and because you don't have a 'session' on that server it thinks you are logged out)","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/01/27 17:57:04 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Great – let’s go with the cookie then and see how we get on!

We also have the problem that the image isn't currently replaced / suppressed, only the main page that shows the image and possible links to that page.\n\nThe ideal solution would probably be a mix of suppression (when a checkbox is checked, we won't return this webcam to hub pages and/or components) but also to replace the image itself (and all the various repurposing / thumbnails of the image) with a holding image, the tricky thing is here is to stop the feed overwriting the 'holding image' when it next runs.\n\nIn short, the above is not something we can get in place this afternoon although we can try and push forward the priority on this work.\n\nYou should however be able suppress the webcam (via the checkbox on the page) and then republish the page, the homepage and hub pages, I think if you do that the webcam will be removed from the hub and homepage.\n\nJamie\n\nOn 9 Sep 2011, at 13:39, Tom Price-Stephens wrote:\n\n> Hi Jamie,\n>  \n> Following up from speaking to Danny,\n>  \n> There is a chance the webcams will be taken offline today for a number of days (something to do with scaffolding).\n>  \n> Apparently we have a holding page we can put in the webcam player – something along the lines of “webcam currently unavailable”\n>  \n> But we also would like to take the webcam option from the homepage?
