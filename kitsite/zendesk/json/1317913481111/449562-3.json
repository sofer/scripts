I have provided a review below for everyone and new action points.\r\n \r\n-          Manual vs Dynamic tag generation\r\n\r\no   This still needs to be discussed with Kitsite, but the view at this stage is that dynamic tag generation is going to be the preference due to the following reason:\r\n\r\n§  Easier to implement\r\n\r\n§  There will be a communication process requirement via developers – trafficker, in either situation so it makes sense that if in the short time frames that we have to implement this that we go with this process.\r\n\r\n-          Iframe vs Javascript\r\n\r\no   Based on conversations with D3, we are going to be use iframes to upload our adverts. The reason being that the ad loading will not impact the page load.\r\n\r\n-          Allowing 3rd Party ad Tags\r\n\r\no   We still need to discuss this point with the Partners to understand how important a factor this is. We will focus on this point after we have got the ad serving up and running.\r\n\r\nActions ( in addition to the ones below):\r\n-          Morag to arrange meeting/ call with Kitsite to run through tagging preference and timelines for implementation\r\n\r\n-          Erin to set up users in DFP\r\n\r\n-          Erin to produce a javascrpt and iframe tag with a test creative for testing by Kitsite and Technology. Erin will send this to Morag by the EOP on Friday\r\n\r\n-          Colin/ Aaron/Technology to let us know testing timeline, ideally we will have all the tags implemented by 19th August. Testing could be scheduled w/c 22nd so that we are ready to go live on 1st September\r\n\r\nAny questions please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nErin\r\n \r\n \r\nKind Regards\r\n \r\nErin Berger\r\nTelephone:  +44 (0) 203 2012 061\r\nMobile:  +44 (0) 791 2999557\r\n \r\n \r\nFrom: Erin Berger \r\nSent: 09 August 2011 14:07\r\nTo: Morag Reavley; Liz Goulding; Tom Price-Stephens; Colin Miller; Aaron Shone\r\nCc: Dipesh Morjaria; Erin Berger\r\nSubject: RE: Follow up from DoubleClick Training: Action Plan\r\n \r\nAll,\r\n\r\nThank you for your time today, it was very useful and I am glad we are all linked up now.\r\n \r\nI have listed below the following action points and assigned who is responsible for each one. We need to have everything in place so we can begin serving advertising on the current website by 1st September.\r\n \r\nActions Plan\r\n1.      EB to speak to DoubleClick to get clarification/ information on the below ahead of our meeting on Thursday.\r\n\r\na.      Outline the benefits of manual tag generation vs. dynamic\r\n\r\nb.      Send over Technical Specification document\r\n\r\nc.       If using either java script or an iframe what would appear on the site should there be an error. Is it a 404 message or a blank screen? I am imagining a tag is generated but there is no creative assigned to it. Could we assign a default in-house creative?\r\n\r\nd.      Regarding 3rd Party ad tags: From the DoubleClick preferred list of 3rd Party providers, how has DoubleClick selected this list? Have you asked for confirmation that they take certain security process on their platforms to ensure that security issues are minimised?\r\n\r\n2.      MR to ask Kitsite if it is ok to point LOCOG CDN at Kitsite demo-site\r\n\r\n3.      Once MR receives Technical Specification Document from EB, speak to Kitsite to discuss tagging implementation preference\r\n\r\n4.      LG to raise point 2 with D3 tomorrow\r\n\r\n5.      EB to generate test code by Friday 12th August for Kitsite to begin testing. EB will send code to MR\r\n\r\n6.      w/c 15th August Tag generation Kitsite and EB\r\n\r\n7.      w/c 22nd August test the platform for:\r\n\r\na.      Tagging implementation- EB/DM/ Kitsite\r\n\r\nb.      Trafficking set up – EB/ DM\r\n\r\nc.       Security concerns- Technology Team\r\n\r\nd.      Load issues- Technology Team\r\n\r\n8.      Tuesday 30th August- EB to traffic really inventory into  platform\r\n\r\n9.      Wednesday 31st August final testing\r\n\r\n10.  Thursday 1st September – live adverts on site\r\n\r\nIf I have missed anything please feel free to let me know.\r\n \r\nMany thanks\r\nErin\r\n \r\nKind Regards\r\n \r\nErin Berger\r\nTelephone:  +44 (0) 203 2012 061\r\nMobile:  +44 (0) 791 2999557\r\n \r\n \r\nFrom: Erin Berger \r\nSent: 08 August 2011 10:30\r\nTo: Morag Reavley; Liz Goulding; Tom Price-Stephens\r\nCc: Dipesh Morjaria\r\nSubject: Follow up from DoubleClick Training\r\n \r\nGood Morning everyone,\r\n \r\nThanks for your time on Friday, I thought it was a really productive session and I am really looking forward to us being able to play around with the platform later this week.  \r\n \r\nMorag, I have asked Kudah to send over any technical documentation that he can today. Also we are going to be doing a follow up session on Thursday 11th, I am not too sure where as yet but I recall the afternoon was best. Kudah said he could spend some extra time with you Morag if you feel it is necessary.\r\n \r\nI feel that there a some key points raised on Friday that we need to address urgently amongst ourselves and also with technology. I have listed them below.\r\nTagging\r\n-          Now that we have seen what is involved in generating the tags across two levels, we need to really review the sitemap and determine who we approach the tagging.\r\n\r\nW    Questions to consider:\r\n\r\n·         Do we do it dynamically or manually\r\n\r\n·         Pro for dynamically- a lot simpler to implement.\r\n\r\n·         Con more risk- if the sitemap changes then there needs to be a new tag generated. More communication required between developers and trafficker.\r\n\r\n-         3rd party Tags\r\n\r\n        There may be a requirement to allow 3rd Part tags; they allow Partners the flexibility to change creative on their side without going through LOCOG. All creative would have to be pre-approved. I do appreciate however that there may be some concerns around security from technology around this offering. We need to gather a list of approved 3rd Party tag suppliers from Kudah and then discuss this with Technology.\r\n\r\n \r\niFrames\r\n        We discussed using iFrames for the ad slots. The feedback from DoubleClick was that, as we are not offering any expandable ad slots then it would be recommended to use iframes as they do not impact the loading of the page as the ad loads separately in the iframe. Is everyone in agreement that we use iframes?  From a implementation point of view it seems straight forward that you just select iFrame when we generate the tags.\r\n\r\nI will put some time in everyone’s calendar to review this ahead of our catch up with Kudah on Thursday.  I would really like to have someone from Technology there to have their input, is there a contact I could invite?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nErin\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nErin Berger\r\n \r\nDigital Media Project Manager\r\nTelephone:  +44 (0) 203 2012 061\r\nMobile:  +44 (0) 791 2999557\r\n \r\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\r\nOne Churchill Place\r\nCanary Wharf\r\nLondon E14 5LN\r\nlondon2012.com\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/08/16 14:45:39 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Did you get the code okay?\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2011/08/16 15:12:30 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Yep, got it fine..","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/08/16 18:24:44 +0100","attachments":[{"size":28531,"created_at":"2011/08/16 18:24:44 +0100","content_type":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","token":"0tik9akxumxraui","id":60370792,"filename":"London_2012_sitemap_-_10_August_2012.xlsx","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/0tik9akxumxraui/?name=London_2012_sitemap_-_10_August_2012.xlsx"}],"via_id":4,"value":"Please find attached a sitemap showing how we propose to breakdown the site.\n\nBasically we’ll aim to drill down to level 2 and 3 functionality in terms of sub-section granularity.\n\nWill you just pull through the exact section paths into the pages?

The URL should point to a .mpg, .mpeg, .mp4, .m4v, .mov, .wmv, .asf, .avi, .ra, .ram, .rm, .flv, or other video file format, and can be omitted if <video:player_loc> is specified. However, because Google needs to be able to check that the Flash object is actually a player for video (as opposed to some other use of Flash, e.g. games and animations), it's helpful to provide both.\r\n\r\n2) <video:player_loc>\r\nAt least one of <video:player_loc> or <video:content_loc> is required. A URL pointing to a Flash player for a specific video. In general, this is the information in the src element of an <embed> tag and should not be the same as the content of the <loc> tag. Since each video is uniquely identified by its content URL (the location of the actual video file) or, if a content URL is not present, a player URL (a URL pointing to a player for the video), you must include either the <video:player_loc> or <video:content_loc> tags. If these tags are omitted and we can't find this information, we'll be unable to index your video.\r\nThe optional attribute allow_embed specifies whether Google can embed the video in search results. Allowed values are Yes or No.\r\nThe optional attribute autoplay has a user-defined string (in the example above, ap=1) that Google may append (if appropriate) to the flashvars parameter to enable autoplay of the video. For example: <embed src=\"http://www.example.com/videoplayer.swf?video=123\" autoplay=\"ap=1\"/>.\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/07/25 15:40:27 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi Andy,\r\n\r\nHave spoken to TwoFour, here's an update:\r\n\r\nGood news is we can get at the src video attribute (ie. the one we need to supply to Google) via the *new* TwoFour API \r\n\r\nWe're currently migrating to the new API so I have asked Kieran to additionally pull this this parameter across as part of that work, we need to make an extra SOAP call to get this field and a few other changes, but it's nothing too onerous so we should be able to get those changes in place today.\r\n\r\nSo all we are waiting on now is the go ahead from Tom (Price Stephens) to switch over to the new API -

This stage will involve:\r\n1. Email sent to 15,000 people randomly selected from the Expressions of Interest sign up process which launches on 12 August (not in Kitsite scope)\r\n2. This email sends them details on the next stage, plus a unique link to a semi-populated application form (using data already captured from them) (this is something Ceremonies would like Kitsite to deliver)\r\n3. The form collects some additional data (see data doc attached) plus allows them to select in preference three audition dates randomly selected from a range (this is something Ceremonies would like Kitsite to deliver). Data is passed to the Ceremonies team as in the same way as the data from the 12 August sign up\r\n4. The Ceremonies team allocates auditions to participants by email (not in Kitsite scope)\r\n5. By January 2012 selected cast members will be able to login to a separate portal (built by the Ceremonies) which will allow them to see their details such as rehearsals (not in Kitsite scope)\r\n\r\nIn their brief (attached) they seem to be suggesting that users set a password which is encrypted\r\n\r\nThe timeline seems to me ridiculous, but suspending disbelief until I hear your thoughts. They want to get this live by the end of August. If they can't get the whole form with all the fields live by then, they would consider launching with some basic information plus audition selection and then inviting people to provide further information later (e.g. NI number, Passport, Previous addresses).\r\n\r\nTheir brief is not crystal clear, so might be best to do a quick call to run through it.

We could use some form of hash/checksum in the url but that would require that each email was seeded with a unique hash value, we'd also need to store that save hash value in our user DB. Probably need to thrash that out.\n\n- Is \"3.1.1 Functionality : Form can be saved at any point but cannot be submitted until completed\" a requirement, it may be tricky to implement (using the current architecture).\n\n- It's not totally clear but it looks as if this phase II form has fields that depend on previous questions, ie. 'What is your Nationality?' (If no Visa required go to 6.1) 'At Current Residential Address. If under 3 years go to'\n\nTimescales aside, we could certainly handle this functionality with the current architecture. However the way we are implementing the first phase is not the ideal architecture if this is to grow into anything more complex ie. a user registration / management system. For a start the current architecture is very one way, with the front end communication to the CMS via XML API's. We normally just see User data being submitted from the front end to the CMS, rather than the inverse (the UMS is an exception to this rule). This may lead to features that may be easy to build in a different architecture/platform, actually being tricky to implement or ending up with us trying to \"push round pegs in square holes\".\n\nI mention the above as if we were given more time, I would suggest a different approach / architecture for this kind of project (we'd probably suggest Rails). We haven't done that as I assume Ceremonies are about to go live with their own system built in Django (a perfectly sensible choice for something like this) and the bureaucracy involved in using or setting up another architecture is not worth imagining :-)\n\nHappy to have a chat...\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/08/05 13:10:10 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi Morag,\r\n\r\n1) The form is here\r\nhttps://vip_staging_locog_www.london2012.com/test/volunteering/ceremonies-application.php\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\ni) the (?) have just gone skeewiff, the should be at the end, we working on it.\r\nii) we need text for the (?) boxes\r\niii) we need text for 'TBD Disclaimer'\r\n\r\n2) You can see them arrive here\r\nhttps://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/data/ceremonyregistrants\r\n\r\nNotes: Campbell's not expecting to login here, but it's an easy way to clear out unwanted records, check what is arriving (or not arriving)\r\n\r\n3) This is the web-service feed / API that Campbell will call to retrieve users.\r\nhttps://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/api/custom/ceremony-applicants?apiKey=-VNs9VeNrmvoiuuuET82kQ\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\ni) we are still to append a from= parameters to this API so Campbell can retrieve just the deltas.\r\nii) we need to setup an personal API key for Campbell (the above API key is just a general purpose one for testing) \r\n\r\nLastly, we haven't done any extensive overall testing yet / so please set expectations accordingly !!\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/08/08 19:11:17 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hello\r\n\r\nJust to update on this:\r\n\r\n1.

The reason for this new method is so that Morag/others can - if required - add/amend short-urls without accidentally enabling the homepage takeover ahead of time:\r\n\r\n- Edit this page (http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/pages/edit/includes/homepage-takeover.php) in the CMS.\r\n- There is a hyperlink container named \"splashPage\". Whatever this fragment links to will become the \"splash page\". i.e. you should use the \"link\" tool to pick the whatever page or asset you want the splash page to be. NB It can even be a link to an external website (just enter the url into the link picker).\r\n- Once you've chosen the splash destination, save and publish includes/homepage-takeover.php.\r\n- As soon as this page goes live, the homepage will redirect to the splash page.\r\n\r\n- Removing: To remove the splash page redirect, edit the page again in the CMS (http://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/pages/edit/includes/homepage-takeover.php) and use the (X) tool to remove the link assigned to the \"splashPage\" container. Publish includes/homepage-takeover.php.

The box that the Kitsite staging servers sit on is about to run out of swap file space so we need to reboot it. Will the CMS spot that the publish destination has disappeared and pause the queue until it's back, or would you suggest manually pausing the queue until we're done?\n\nCheers,\nAndy\n\nFrom: Russ Ede\nSent: 19 August 2011 14:24\nTo: Andy Watkins\nSubject: Esx03 swap file usage - restart needed\n\nHi there Andy\n\nJust to show where we are with this and why we need to do this today.\n\nEsx03 contains both stage03 and stage04 and will be restarted with each of the virtual machines on it in turn.\n\nRuss\n\n[cid:image001.png@01CC5E7B.9340D630]\n\nRuss Ede\n\nTechnology Service Delivery\nDirect line:  +44 (0)30 2012 0204\nMobile: 07760 758933\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nOne Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\nlondon2012.com<http://www.london2012.com/>\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.
