As these are not particularly SEO-friendly, pages can\nalso be assigned an SEO-path. The client is NOT served a redirect, the path\nis rewritten on the server. These are contained in SEO.csv, attached.\n\n\"Marketing\" redirects: Paths that are shortened for ease-of-remembering\n(e.g. for advertising campaigns). A permanent redirect is served. These are\ncontained in Marketing.csv, attached. Note that a few of these actually\nredirect to external sites.\n\nAd-hoc redirects/rewrites: Links/paths that have been circulated/published\nerroneously. Plus some paths that have deliberately been changed, but that\nmight have been extensively linked to. Plus some sensible redirects for\ndeleted pages.\nPlus some url-rewrites to generate nicer urls for certain parts of the\nwebsite (for example /path/to/$id => /path/to/file.php/id=$id).\nAs these are more varied than the above rewrites, it is not really possible\nto express them as simple \"X gets mapped to Y\" rules. Therefore I'm\nattaching the relevant Apache configuration directives which you can use or\nignore, depending on requirements. If you need any more information about\nthese rules, please ask me.\n\nKind regards,\n\nKieran","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"attachments":[],"created_at":"2012/03/19 12:39:06 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Marking as solved.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926}],"field_97116":"0.4","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","linkings":[],"score":30,"resolution_time":338,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"capped cms its this_week","assignee_id":3663591,"updated_at":"2012/04/17 10:26:14 +0100","req_name":"Jacob Melton","ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2012/04/17 10:26:14 +0100","solved_at":"2012/03/19 12:39:06 +0000","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"capped","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2012/03/05 11:05:21 +0000","via_id":27,"subject":"RE: [PostCMS support] Re: Redirect details request","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"permissions":{},"submitter_id":149994292,"base_score":30,"latest_recipients":"kieran@kitsite.com support+idB2EY-RQQV@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":"Jamie Unwin, Tom Price Stephens","problem_id":null,"status_id":4,"description":"This is a follow-up to your previous request #7059 \"Redirect details request\"\n\nHi Jamie,\nHope you’re well.
