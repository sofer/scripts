screen grabs, the lock/unlock is used to 'check out a page' manually.\n\nWhen your editing a page the page is also checked out automatically and checked back in when you save the page. \n\nIt's basically 'checked out' so that no one else can edit the page while you are editing it (only one person can update a single page at a time for obvious reasons)\n\nNot saying that someone manually did this, there are occasions when a page isn't automatically checked in (your browser crashing before you close the page can cause this).\n\nAlthough possibility is some other process checked the page out, for example the translation feed, locks or 'checks out' the page which it makes any automated updates to the page/\n\nJamie\n\n\n\nScreen shot 2011-10-07 at 11.26.59.png\nScreen shot 2011-10-07

In short the problem / solution is not clear cut - with many people arguing that what we are doing is correct and the parser / validator is wrong]\n\nJamie\n\n1) Frame titles\n\n- We have added a title to the eDialog iFrame [ title=\"Signup form\" ]\n\n- But the Google+ iframe is actually written out by Google we just load a script which then rewrite the tags below into the iFrame that Ability.net are seeing.\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js\"><\/script> \n<g:plusone size=\"medium\"></g:plusone>\n\nWe therefore have no control of the iFrame code that Google writes into the page. \n\n2a) Parsing errors - Doubleclick\n\nThese are due to the Doubleclick tags? Not out writing out of them? We can remove the hspace=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" but need to check with Erin/Doubleclick/Google if this will cause issues.\n\n- Line 27, Column 251: there is no attribute \"hspace\"\n…ginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scroll…\n\nLine 32, Column 125: required attribute \"alt\" not specified\n…gs_settings;sz=728x90;tile=1;lang=en;ord=1316513423?' width='728' height='90'/>\n\n2b) Parsing errors - Google +1\n\nThis is because Google are using their own tag <g:plusone> into the page.\n\n[This is a very well known, documented and discussed issue, the problem / solution is not clear cut - with many arguing that what we are doing is correct and the parser / validator is wrong]\n\nLine 67, Column 172: there is no attribute \"size\"\n…/plusone.js\"><\/script><g:plusone size=\"medium\"></g:plusone></li><li id=\"so-fac…\n\nLine 67, Column 180: element \"g:plusone\" undefined\n….js\"><\/script><g:plusone size=\"medium\"></g:plusone></li><li id=\"so-facebook\"><…\n\nThis issue is documented here:\nhttp://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Webmasters/thread?tid=51eb2ff3e340bc76&hl=en\n\nThere are people suggesting using a <div> tag instead of the <g:plusone> but we'd need to investigate further if this will cause other issues, the code Tom supplied was in the <g:plusone> format and that is the format Google suggest is used.\n\n2c) Parsing errors - Facebook\n\nThis is a very similar issue to above, namely Facebook specific tags <fb:like/> which the W3C doesnt' like as is doesn't know about them.\n\n[Once again this is a very well known, documented and discussed issue, the problem / solution is not clear cut - with many arguing that what we are doing is correct and the parser / validator is wrong]\n\nLine 67, Column 379: there is no attribute \"href\"\n…4&amp;xfbml=1\"><\/script><fb:like href=\"https://www.facebook.com/London2012\" se…\n\nThe correct solution here, which we have previously implemented (although I think we took out in the ned) is to add a namespace attribute to the page so that the <fb:> and <g:> tags are not part of the document, but the W3C validator seems to ignore the namespace declaration. Kieran spent quite an amount of time investigating this a few weeks back when we added the Google +1 tags. It may be best if II let him explain direct (to you or whoever need to know).\n\n3) Non-text content [ref: 1.1.1] – LOCOG logo needs descriptive\n\nThe site says \"LOCOG logo\" across the site it always has, ironically I think we were previously told to use \"LOCOG logo\" as it was descriptive of the image (along the acronym LOOCG probably isn't that obvious).\n\nIf you want we could change it, but I don't think we should change it only in one place? hence we'll need to bulk republish the site, this is unrelated to the e-signup pages specifically.\n\nIs changing this a priority for launching eDialog?\n\n4) Focus visible [ref: 2.4.7] – Three Stylesheet links show no focus indicator\n\nThis is common to the whole site, I am not sure this has ever been an issue before / it was never in the designs. \n\nOnce again this is a moderately significant site wide change, unrelated to the e-signup pages specifically, I think we probably need to agree what this wil look like . check it cross browser first before rolling it out.\n\nIs changing this a priority for launching eDialog?","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/20 12:26:40 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"See http://postcms.zendesk.com/tickets/5012 \"the 2012 home page doesn't validate\" raised by Kieran a couple of weeks ago.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/23 11:34:17 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Danny,\r\n\r\nNeed to be careful with this ticket / what it contains, there is a multitude of tasks that may or not be getting tracked correctly, there may be other tickets that cover a sub set of these tasks.\r\n\r\n- The actual dev work work on the e-dialog page [7 days]\r\n- The in initial / additional conference calls / investigation / correspondence with LOCOG / e-dialog over the above [3 days, so far]\r\n- The modification of the login links (to signup) plus any redirects in preparation of the switch over [0.5 days]\r\n- The disabling of commenting and photo upload [0.5 days]\r\n- The deployment of any code / switch over [to do]\r\n- The rewriting of blog commenting / photo upload (these should be, and I think are separate tickets?)\r\n- Ability.net changes re. parse errors with Facebook, Google + and double click [so far 0.5 day, ongoing..]\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/10/06 12:01:48 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"New tickets opened: #4284 and #4285.

We're publishing the new www.londonpreparesseries.com pages in a few minutes. All's well, just a bunch of new sports with events to publicise. We do have one issue we could use your advice on though. Abilitynet sent us the feedback below when we enquired specifically about www.londonpreparesseries.com/goalball . The Goalball pages will be read by a lot of blind people so we're keen to make them in particular as accessible as possible.\n\nI figure there are reasons Cogapp coded stuff in the way they did, and don't know where you may have influenced / altered any of the below, but do you have any thoughts as to whether AbilityNet's suggestions below are implementable without causing any disruption?\n\nIssue\n\nThe text 'London International Goalball Tournament' in the header (see Fig 4) of all pages is not read by screen readers as it is currently only coded as:\n\n\n\n<div id=\"lps-logo\"></div>.\n\n\n\n[cid:image001.jpg@01CC7C3D.CC3B2820]Fig 4 - Page title\n\nRecommendation\nIt is recommended that this text be coded with <h1>, as the first header of each page.\n\nIssue\nThere is also an issue with the footer as Fig 5 below shows. The left section of the footer has a heading element used for no content (see the code section below).\nCode:\n<div id=\"footer\" class=\"global\">\n<h3 class=\"left-title\"></h3\n><h3 class=\"right-title\">International Federation</h3>\nThere is also an issue with the header on the right side of the footer, 'International Federation' as this should not be coded as a header as it is not a heading.\n[cid:image002.jpg@01CC7C3D.CC3B2820]\n\nFig 5 - Site footer with headings\n\nRecommendation\nIt is recommended that the h3 tags in this instance are removed as they are not necessary and will be confusing for screen reader users.
