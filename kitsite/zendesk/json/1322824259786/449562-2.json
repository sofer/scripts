This is because the contents of the requests cannot be investigated due to the encryption. In this case, there are 3 options:\r\n\r\n\t▪\tWeb server proxies. An initial web server decodes the SSL requests, and forwards the request onto one of the servers in the cluster. Fairly simple to set up, but causes increased load on the proxy. Also the proxy is a single point of failure, which is more likely to fail considering the amount of work it has to perform.\r\n\t\r\n--> Akamai ?\r\n\r\n▪\tHardware SSL decoders. Hardware in the router or load balancer that is capable of decoding the HTTPS requests, and determining the session information stored in them. These are fast and less likely to fail than a web server proxy, but often more difficult to set up and with pricing based on their power.\r\n\r\n--> BT ?\r\n\r\n\t▪\tIP address-based server allocation. All requests from a given IP address or range are sent to the same server. This is by far the easiest and cheapest method, and allows the router or load-balancer to do all the work. However, their may be more chance of an unevenly distributed load with this method if most of the load comes from a single IP/range. For example, all requests are coming from the same university, will all be sent to the same server.\r\n\r\n--> Incompatible with Akamai?","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/02/09 20:39:29 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Frustratingly, Akamai /can/ unravel the https requests.

Yes\n- Other than the role specific question above, I can't see any fields that depend on the answers to previous fields, but can I just check this is correct? Yes – depending on role you select this determines which questions you get for 1 and/or two but this is the only dependent field.\n- Can we assume that the fields will be fixed / agreed and will not change post us starting work? or that if they are you are prepared for possibly significant additional costs / delays. If we are aware before speccing the work that text may change then we can look making this process more manageable, but obviously it will cost more to build that flexibility into the system. – no once we are live they will be fixed\n\nRegarding the backend, obviously the easier it is to use the better. My main requirement will be to be able to print off the applications to take to interview (so all the information is easy to read in the interview) and to do analysis to make sure an organisation hasn’t applied more than once for the same role, report on the number of roles they have applied for, look at the number of applications per role. Other solutions we are evaluating are cheap but have quite basic backend functionality e.g. using adobe forms. It would be great if you could cost with a csv backend but also something a bit more sophisticated with tabs.\nDo you know how long it will take you to get a view on costs, I am really keen to make a decision by the end of the week as I know we are running short of time.\n\nIf it is easier to chat about any of these requirements please do not hesitate to call me on 02032012656.\n\nThanks\nJess\n\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/07/06 10:26:03 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Speak to you post 5\n\nEnjoy the training :)\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/07/13 12:20:08 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Hi Morag,\r\n\r\nJust wanted to pick this back up, I know we had 90% of a conversation on it but kind of forgot if I was waiting on any info back from yourself or Jess or if you we're waiting on me.\r\n\r\nShould I go ahead and create a proposal based on your requirements and our understanding of how we would implement them, with that level of time/budget?

Ceremonies; in that if from the outset we had knew the form was going to get more complex, much like Ceremonies, we may have suggested a different route / approach; indeed as we have only just started on this piece of work that is still an option; I will discuss internally). \n\nMuch as I don't like to turn work down. I do wonder if (we can't go down the Rails route) it is better to just say no now in order to stem any further feature creep on a piece of work that is already fairly tight on timescale and already a large single page form. The biggest danger / risk / problem with all these data capture projects is flux or creep around the fields that need to be captured (inevitable to some extent, as more people are aware of the project and want the form to capture data pertinent to them, but equally a risk in terms of regression and errors creeping in / deadlines being missed).\n\nThat said we haven't gone so far that it would be a massive disruption to add the extra fields at this stage, although I would question whether you can have a form this long on one page without a 'save' option and therefore it may be worth quickly deciding if we would be better off re-scoping the project as a Rails app with a 4 stage / page form, that can be saved at any stage (although lack of lead time - to allow BTS to agree to us using a hosted Rails server - rather than development time is probably the biggest hurdle in a late change in architecture/approach; )\n\nCan I also check the client is OK with this just living on a standard Games maker template, we haven't costed for any kind of complex design work above the standard form layout and page look and feel.

If we did something more designed we would use a separate budget and could use a separate designer for page layout, but I think the issue is time. I’m assuming there isn’t time to get a third party to do any html production (when would you need it for)?\n\nMorag\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/12 17:35:52 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Due: september 22.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/12 17:58:47 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"See attached.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[{"size":253619,"created_at":"2011/08/12 17:58:25 +0100","content_type":"application/pdf","token":"3eblviv1opflvxs","id":59843322,"filename":"LOCOG_-_Young_Games_Maker_application_v2.pdf","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/3eblviv1opflvxs/?name=LOCOG_-_Young_Games_Maker_application_v2.pdf"}]},{"created_at":"2011/08/15 16:30:30 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Meeting on Tuesday at 9am to review the above, mock ups and a couple of minor changes around data drop downs.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":51647622,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/15 16:42:58 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Wording for the application form introduction (main landing page) :\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for choosing to apply to the Young Games Maker programme.

However, the \"apostrophe fix\" appears (given the issue you raised) not to work in \"SharePoint\".\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I don't have any experience of SharePoint, but I would suggest that it might be an idea to do something approximating:\r\n\r\n 1. Select the entire column containing the telephone numbers.\r\n 2. Find the menu item, or control button that that allows you to specify the \"display format\" (possibly known as \"field format\").\r\n 3. Select a display format of \"text\", or \"unformatted\", or \"raw text\" / other. Basically you're looking for a format that ISN'T a number type.\r\n\r\nThe problem incidentally is that spreadsheet software treats fields as numbers by default. This means that the following issues arise when displaying fields containing telephone numbers:\r\n 1. Leading \"0\"s are omitted (as they're redundant when displaying numbers).\r\n 2. When the field reaches a certain length (i.e. over about 10 digits) numbers get displayed in scientific notation (e.g. 2.5234+E11).\r\nYou don't want either of these behaviours for telephone numbers, so you need to tell SharePojnt that these fields are NOT numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please ask, but bear in mind that I don't have a copy of SharePoint so I can't answer SharePoint-related questions with any authority!\r\n\r\nI hope this helps,\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nKieran","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/11/09 12:29:29 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Thanks Kieran\n\nI have adapted your process for Windows based Excel asked the HR team to see if that works for them.\n\nI have added to export changes to Current section of Pivotal.

Just spoke to Danny about this on the phone, info on first possible date you could do this would be much appreciated. If there's any room to do it on Monday then the news will be particularly welcomed.\n\n\n1)      We're going to use the 'Mascot splash' template in the london2012.com CMS to aggregate content related to the London 2012 mascots' song that's on sale. Currently the template is hard-coded to pull in the main scrolling banner images from the same place no matter how many times you replicate it on the site. Those images are http://www.london2012.com/images/mascots/mascot1.jpg and http://www.london2012.com/images/mascots/mascot2.jpg .\n\n\n\nFor the version of the template that currently sits at http://www.london2012.com/games/mascots/index.php we'd like this to remain the same. However, for the new version of the template that I've created at http://www.london2012.com/games/mascots/mascot-song/index.php but haven't published yet, we'd like to pull in two different images instead (eg. .../mascot3.jpg and .../mascot4.jpg ?). Can this be altered in the code fairly easily?\n\n\n\n\n2)      We would like the Facebook and Twitter social buttons in the breadcrumb on the new page at http://www.london2012.com/games/mascots/mascot-song/index.php to act as shares rather than subscriptions. This would mean:\n\n\n-          changing the Twitter 'follow' button to a 'tweet' button (which pre-populates a tweet linking back to the page). The current link to @London2012 that sits next to the 'follow' button could be replaced by a counter reflecting how many times the new 'tweet' button has been used.\n\n\n\n-          Changing the function of the 'Like' button to 'share' of the link on the user's Facebook wall. The counter for this button will need to be reset to reflect the number of times the page has been shared\n\n\n\n-          The +1 button can stay the same as it already serves the purpose we want.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinn Concannon\nNew Media Producer\nLOCOG New Media\nDirect line:  +44 (0)20 3 2012 918\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nOne Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\nFax: +44 (0) 203 2012 001\nwww.london2012.com\n\nP Please consider the environment before printing this email\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.
