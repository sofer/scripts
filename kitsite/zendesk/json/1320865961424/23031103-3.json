No always just one and two, maybe just one sometime if the sport doesn’t want to add another question. also will the type always be a free text box? Yes\n- Other than the role specific question above, I can't see any fields that depend on the answers to previous fields, but can I just check this is correct? Yes – depending on role you select this determines which questions you get for 1 and/or two but this is the only dependent field.\n- Can we assume that the fields will be fixed / agreed and will not change post us starting work? or that if they are you are prepared for possibly significant additional costs / delays. If we are aware before speccing the work that text may change then we can look making this process more manageable, but obviously it will cost more to build that flexibility into the system. – no once we are live they will be fixed\n\nRegarding the backend, obviously the easier it is to use the better. My main requirement will be to be able to print off the applications to take to interview (so all the information is easy to read in the interview) and to do analysis to make sure an organisation hasn’t applied more than once for the same role, report on the number of roles they have applied for, look at the number of applications per role. Other solutions we are evaluating are cheap but have quite basic backend functionality e.g. using adobe forms. It would be great if you could cost with a csv backend but also something a bit more sophisticated with tabs.\nDo you know how long it will take you to get a view on costs, I am really keen to make a decision by the end of the week as I know we are running short of time.\n\nIf it is easier to chat about any of these requirements please do not hesitate to call me on 02032012656.\n\nThanks\nJess\n\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2011/07/06 10:26:03 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Speak to you post 5\n\nEnjoy the training :)\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/07/13 12:20:08 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi Morag,\r\n\r\nJust wanted to pick this back up, I know we had 90% of a conversation on it but kind of forgot if I was waiting on any info back from yourself or Jess or if you we're waiting on me.\r\n\r\nShould I go ahead and create a proposal based on your requirements and our understanding of how we would implement them, with that level of time/budget?

Ceremonies; in that if from the outset we had knew the form was going to get more complex, much like Ceremonies, we may have suggested a different route / approach; indeed as we have only just started on this piece of work that is still an option; I will discuss internally). \n\nMuch as I don't like to turn work down. I do wonder if (we can't go down the Rails route) it is better to just say no now in order to stem any further feature creep on a piece of work that is already fairly tight on timescale and already a large single page form. The biggest danger / risk / problem with all these data capture projects is flux or creep around the fields that need to be captured (inevitable to some extent, as more people are aware of the project and want the form to capture data pertinent to them, but equally a risk in terms of regression and errors creeping in / deadlines being missed).\n\nThat said we haven't gone so far that it would be a massive disruption to add the extra fields at this stage, although I would question whether you can have a form this long on one page without a 'save' option and therefore it may be worth quickly deciding if we would be better off re-scoping the project as a Rails app with a 4 stage / page form, that can be saved at any stage (although lack of lead time - to allow BTS to agree to us using a hosted Rails server - rather than development time is probably the biggest hurdle in a late change in architecture/approach; )\n\nCan I also check the client is OK with this just living on a standard Games maker template, we haven't costed for any kind of complex design work above the standard form layout and page look and feel. We were thinking along the lines of the accessible volunteer form.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/08/03 12:38:30 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Thanks, Jamie.\n\nMy feeling is that we say ‘no’ to any form amplification, for the reasons of a) time b) added complexity to the form c) the requirement to have to save the form (which I think would be key, given there are two people involved here).\n\nPage design – I think the basic GM form is fine. If we did something more designed we would use a separate budget and could use a separate designer for page layout, but I think the issue is time. I’m assuming there isn’t time to get a third party to do any html production (when would you need it for)?\n\nMorag\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2011/08/12 17:35:52 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Due: september 22.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/08/12 17:58:47 +0100","attachments":[{"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/3eblviv1opflvxs/?name=LOCOG_-_Young_Games_Maker_application_v2.pdf","size":253619,"created_at":"2011/08/12 17:58:25 +0100","content_type":"application/pdf","token":"3eblviv1opflvxs","id":59843322,"filename":"LOCOG_-_Young_Games_Maker_application_v2.pdf","is_public":true}],"via_id":0,"value":"See attached.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/08/15 16:30:30 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Meeting on Tuesday at 9am to review the above, mock ups and a couple of minor changes around data drop downs.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":51647622},{"created_at":"2011/08/15 16:42:58 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Wording for the application form introduction (main landing page) :\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for choosing to apply to the Young Games Maker programme.

However, the \"apostrophe fix\" appears (given the issue you raised) not to work in \"SharePoint\".\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I don't have any experience of SharePoint, but I would suggest that it might be an idea to do something approximating:\r\n\r\n 1. Select the entire column containing the telephone numbers.\r\n 2. Find the menu item, or control button that that allows you to specify the \"display format\" (possibly known as \"field format\").\r\n 3. Select a display format of \"text\", or \"unformatted\", or \"raw text\" / other. Basically you're looking for a format that ISN'T a number type.\r\n\r\nThe problem incidentally is that spreadsheet software treats fields as numbers by default. This means that the following issues arise when displaying fields containing telephone numbers:\r\n 1. Leading \"0\"s are omitted (as they're redundant when displaying numbers).\r\n 2. When the field reaches a certain length (i.e. over about 10 digits) numbers get displayed in scientific notation (e.g. 2.5234+E11).\r\nYou don't want either of these behaviours for telephone numbers, so you need to tell SharePojnt that these fields are NOT numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please ask, but bear in mind that I don't have a copy of SharePoint so I can't answer SharePoint-related questions with any authority!\r\n\r\nI hope this helps,\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nKieran","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2011/11/09 12:29:29 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Thanks Kieran\n\nI have adapted your process for Windows based Excel asked the HR team to see if that works for them.\n\nI have added to export changes to Current section of Pivotal.

Kitsite, the agency who run the CMS (content management system) for london2012.com have been trying to send some automated emails to my london 2012 account and they haven't been getting through.  identical emails have gone to my person account for a test, and they have been.\n\nThis was definitely working last week, but nothing has made it through this week.  Has anything changed over the weekend?\n\nFor background, the server that is sending the mails is: 89.187.66.118 (milo.kitsite.com)\n\nThanks,\n\nLiz\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

(e.g. a request for www.london2012.com/Sports would redirect to www.london2012.com/sports) - before implementing this ensure that canonical URL can only be specified with lower case characters.\nSimple Apache rules exist to implement this logic.

Some of these URL have up to nine parameters. Ideally KitSite could use mod rewrite to make these URL static and remove all unnecessary parameters from an SEO perspective or required by the end user. I would be happy to speak with them if the want to discuss options for addressing this issue. Although this is a lower priority it would be great for them to take a look now as resolving it may go hand in hand with the other SEO optimised URL work that they will be doing.\n\nCheers,\nDavid","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":18087822},{"created_at":"2011/02/03 17:05:48 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hi Andy,\n\nWe have already done some work here in that new canonical url tags have everything bar some core parameters striped out, which should help.\n\nFor example this url:\nhttp://www.london2012.com/photos/search.php?q=Athletes%2BVillage&tag=&start=16&sort=&display=list&age=&related=&scores=&user=\n\nHas a canonical url of (ie. it only has the q params):\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"http://www.london2012.com/photos/search.php?q=Athletes%2BVillage\" />\n\nHowever......\n\nThere is a wider piece of work, which I assume David is alluding to, which is /not/ part of the current SEO work, but which has in fact been on our \"things we could do to improve SEO if someone was willing to pay for it\" ;-) list for a while now, which is to create 'Alias' pages in the CMS.\n\nHow this would work is we would create a new page type or thing in the CMS (called \"URL alias\") which isn't really a page, but could be linked to as if it was a page, the only thing stored with the \"URL alias\" in the CMS is a descriptive name and a url. This page could then be linked to as if it was a normal CMS page but when the link is rendered the url stored with the \"URL alias\" page would be used instead.\n\nYou could then construct a folder of these Aliases one for each Photo Galley and enter / store the appropriate long dynamic url [ http://www.london2012.com/p:hotos/search.php?q=Athletes%2BVillage&tag=&start=16&sort=&display=list&age=&related=&scores=&user= ] with each one. Then when you link to say 'Venue photos' the href that got output would be the path to the alias (or the short url of the Alias page once we have the SEO stuff done) at the server level we'd output a mod_rewrite rule to say, if you see a link to /venues-photos then do an internal redirect to display the contents of this long url.\n\nIf you think this is something that you'd be interested in let me know and I'll try and firm up the exact development required, but as a ballpark in the air expect it would be at least a weeks work.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/02/08 11:31:30 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"A quick update on this one: Jamie's suggestion of \"at least a weeks work\" is likely to be an understatement.

Some of these URL have up to nine parameters. Ideally KitSite could use mod rewrite to make these URL static and remove all unnecessary parameters from an SEO perspective or required by the end user. I would be happy to speak with them if the want to discuss options for addressing this issue. Although this is a lower priority it would be great for them to take a look now as resolving it may go hand in hand with the other SEO optimised URL work that they will be doing.\n\nCheers,\nDavid","organization_id":40584,"assignee_name":"Kieran Topping","updated_by_type_id":1,"requester_id":18087822},{"comments":[{"created_at":"2011/02/03 15:35:17 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Is it possible to bulk create 301 redirects?

Obviously if these are inbound links from other sites (rather than just links in Googles site index) then that is another matter and we probably do need to match them up.\n\nThe one downside to bulk redirects like this is the server load, as every request will need to first run a check to see if it matches any of those redirects, this may seem insignificant at first, but if we ended up with a couple of thousand redirects that could in turn end up adding a significant load to each request especially which when multiplied up by millions of requests \n\nIf the URL follow a pattern ie. the section name has changed or if any pages in /volunteering should now go to the /volunteer hub we may be able to write a single wildcard redirect which would be more efficient.\n\nSo in short, yes we can, if it's external urls from other sites we should (and can we pattern match any of them en-mass?). But if this is just a case of cleaning up Google index it may be better to let Google's indexer go about it's business and drop the old urls and reindex the new ones next time it spiders the site, rather than trying to force anything and clogging up each request with hundreds of redirect lookups (which may grow over time).\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/02/04 16:45:31 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Andy, let us know if you want us to redirect these (and send us the file) or if you think it's OK to let them fall out of Google index and get re indexed naturally.\r\n\r\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/02/04 16:54:42 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Jamie,\n\nI’ve asked David to take a look at this.

Response from David on the 404 proposal is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have included an export of your Google crawl results and unfortunately we are talking about more like 10,000 URL than 300. This will have a significant impact on how this is approached. I think we need to identify wildcards that would forward with a 301 to some new or higher level directory. I am assuming that most of these 10,000 URL are the result of some old URL structure change where no appropriate 301s where put in place when the changes were rolled out. \r\n\r\nThe primary strategy is to redirect as many of these 404 to the appropriate pages using 301 redirects. The secondary strategy would be to have a smart 404 page for the 404 not caught by our rule set that uses search to provide relevant links to what the user is probably looking for. This smart 404 page is very much (OPTIONAL) and will not be necessary if we think we can catch most of the 404 with a rule set.\"\r\n\r\n(I've attached the list of 404s.)\r\n\r\nCould you take a look and tweak your proposal accordingly - hopefully you'll be able to spot a pattern in the 404 so that rules can be used for the redirects.\r\n\r\nI've not commented on the sitemap part of the document as we're handling that elsewhere now.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAndy","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":18087822},{"created_at":"2011/08/01 15:44:19 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Hi, realise you're flat out at the moment, but could you let me know when you'll be able to take a look at this?","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":18087822},{"created_at":"2011/08/30 11:18:27 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"I propose the following:\r\n  1. 403's should yield the error page.\r\n  2.

I don't see any way of doing this without the direct involvement of ITS--and it is not entirely clear that they would be comfortable with taking this on.\r\n\r\nsenderscorecertified.com appears to just be a brand name of Return Path.\r\n\r\nKieran, I am reassigning this to you, just in case you have any other ideas about how we might get round this. Otherwise, we will have to think about this again when Jamie returns.\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/10/20 13:33:58 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"We did discuss the feasibility of sending the signup emails via the 2012 live webservers.\r\nWhile possibly not actually solving the problem, it would at least put the problem in the hands of someone who theoretically has the means of solving it.\r\n\r\nSending email via the live 2012 servers is not without complication!\r\nWhat would be the process?
