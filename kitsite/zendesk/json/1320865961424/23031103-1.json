Potentially.\n\nAt each venue LOCOG will provide Games Mobility devices, you know\nscooters and golf buggies etc.\n\nWe may wish to Create an online form via KitSite from approx Nov/Dec\nto Apr/May. Information in the form would include; venue (drop down);\ndate (corresponding to venue); booking out and in times (based on\non-hours); vehicle type (3 in total but varies per venue therefore\nthese need to line up); name; contact number; email address; and other\ncomments (an open text box for questions/queries).\n\nIdeally these requests would go direct to a mailbox e.g.\nGamesMobility@london2012.com) and LOCOG will respond with a\nconfirmation or decline email (copy to be signed off by Kathryn) and\nfed into SharePoint. However I think we can persuade this team to pick\nup a spreadsheet instead like Young Games Makers.\n\nCould I get a price for doing this bearing in mind that we have\nalternative ways to service the request.\n\nKavita","organization_id":40584,"assignee_name":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":51647622},{"comments":[{"created_at":"2011/10/19 15:24:07 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hi,\n\nWas there any news on this?\n\nThanks\n\nFrom: Michael Thorne\nSent: 04 October 2011 14:55\nTo: 'support@kitsite.com'\nSubject: Adding \"Top Tips\" box in web pages\n\nHi,\n\nThis Getting to the Games page on the London 2012 website - http://www.london2012.com/getting-to-the-games - features a box of the right hand side called 'Top Tips'.\n\nIs it possible for this function to be added to the following three pages?\n\nhttp://www.london2012.com/accessibility\nhttp://www.london2012.com/accommodation\nhttp://www.london2012.com/safety-and-security\n\nThanks,\n\nMichael\n\nMichael Thorne\nContent Coordinator\nEditorial Services department\nDirect line:  +44 (0)20 3 2012 046\n\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\nOne Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5LN\n\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\nFax: +44 (0)20 7719 1308\nlondon2012.com<http://www.london2012.com/>\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

I'm wondering, if all goes\nwell with the 2 \"slave\" frontend servers (web02/03), perhaps the patching of\nweb01 could be scheduled for tomorrow morning instead? There is obviously a\ngreater potential for web01 causing a problem as the content-syncing takes\nplace via it. Although the synching is technically not within our remit,\nthere is a certain class of problem that we might be best placed to solve,\nso I would recommend doing this at a time when we can supply you with a\ndedicated technical resource.\nKind regards,\nKieran\n\n\n\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2011/10/24 10:50:16 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hi Kieran\n\nThis is happening quicker than we first thought - for example, web03 is already patched.\n\nWe can pull the time in for this so that we have your support.

Please can you take a look and\nsend over a quote for this work? I think we will need a quick chat to go\nthrough all of this in detail so that I'm as clear as I can be on what\nwe require - how about Monday?\n\n\n\n1.       Analytics - we are being harassed about measuring the number of\npeople visiting the site, which is absolutely something we should have\nthought about before.

Flash plug-in - there is an issue with the London 2012\nlogo/scrolling pictures on the home page in Internet Explorer.

Alt text on scrolling pictures - we need the alt text to show\nas a yellow box when hovering over the images so that people know where\nthey are.

Full list of publications - The project team want us to add an\noption on each theme page for a full list of publications per theme (ie\na list of all micro reports, case studies, champion products and\nresearch summaries for Sustainability). Can we add a link, or another\nbox for this? Would be great to go through the options and costs for\nthis.\n\n\n\n7.       External links page - we would like to add in External Links\nfor each theme page. I reckon there will be around five external\nwebsites for us to link out to, per theme. Maybe this could sit under\nthe 'related links' on the right? Also would be great to discuss\noptions.\n\n \n\n8.       Technical Overviews - we are publishing some technical\noverviews of the project, which are external papers that we just need to\nlink to. Because these are overviews of the project, and not\ntheme-specific, are we able to add a tab at the top, which takes you to\na page about the overviews?

Case study summaries - there are a number of case studies being\npublished by external organisations next year that we have the\nsummaries/abstracts for. We need these summaries to go on the website\nwith links to the full case studies/publishers. I suggest that these go\nunder the case studies section, or we have another 'box' for case study\nsummaries. However, these aren't documents to upload (as with case\nstudies), so there will be no thumbnail and no physical PDF to link to.\nIt will just need to be a generic image, with the summary/abstract to go\ninto the text box next to the thumbnail, and the link will take you to\nan external website (rather than a PDF).
