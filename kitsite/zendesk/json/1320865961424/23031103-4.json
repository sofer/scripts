I am not entirely sure who last installed the www.london2102.com certificate and/or if we are allowed to install them [am trying to find Kieran to ask if he remembers].

The only thing that *really* need to be made secure is the transmission of data from the form to the CMS once it is posted off. \n\n## I know you have very strict data protection requirements, but I would personally question how personal this data actually is?

I seem to remember Dom saying that the origin server did need a cert installed even if just a self signed one). If this is the case then we'd need to figure out who is to complete this work IPSoft or ourselves. This would need installing on stage03/04 and web01-06. \n\nAlthough I do wonder, in light of everything now sitting behind Akamai whether it would make sense to install a self signed wildcard cert (no reason for a proper one as no one will see it) on stage03/04 and web01-06 so that those servers are setup to handle any sub sites under the london2012.com domain.\n\nProbably best Danny if you liaise with Russ on this / schedule any work in.\n\nthanks\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/08/31 18:28:47 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Thanks Jamie – did not mean to go direct to Danny on this when you had given such a comprehensive answer.\n\nRuss\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":14724144},{"created_at":"2011/08/31 18:39:00 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hi Russ,\n\nNo, I just meant could Danny (who was cc'd in) pick this ticket back up to figure out a schedule / thrash out the details with you for getting this work done.\n\nNot that Danny is my PA ;-) It's just that he has a better overall picture of our availability and probably has more time than me this week to discuss the finer details with yourself and Akamai.\n\nthanks\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/09/05 11:34:28 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Russ, regarding Jamie's list of tasks added in July:\r\n\r\n1/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to generate a CSR (certificate signing request) for festival.london2012.com \r\n2/ LOCOG need to order a SSL certificate using that CSR (for use on web01-06) \r\n3/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to instal the certificates on web01-06 \r\n4/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to update the Apache httpd.conf on web01-06 \r\n5/ Kitsite need to add a rule to each Apache httpd.conf to redirect form traffic to https and non-form traffic back to http \r\n6/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to restart all web servers \r\n7/ Kitsite need to update the HTML/JS to link to a https version of the signup form and the accessible version of the form [need to work out scope of those changes as the form is submitted via AJAX] \r\n8/ We also need to check that every other asset (image, js, css etc.) on the page can also be loaded via https to get round mixed content warnings, as the site is effectively one large JS app this could be a non trivial process (hard to tell without some investigation).\r\n\r\nI can confirm that this is where responsibility lies:\r\n\r\n1/ ipsoft need to generate a CSR (certificate signing request) for festival.london2012.com \r\n2/ LOCOG need to order a SSL certificate using that CSR (for use on web01-06) \r\n3/ ipsoft need to instal the certificates on web01-06 \r\n4/ Kitsite need to update the Apache httpd.conf on web01-06 \r\n5/ Kitsite need to add a rule to each Apache httpd.conf to redirect form traffic to https and non-form traffic back to http \r\n6/ ipsoft need to restart all web servers\r\n7/ Kitsite need to update the HTML/JS to link to a https version of the signup form and the accessible version of the form [need to work out scope of those changes as the form is submitted via AJAX] \r\n8/ We also need to check that every other asset (image, js, css etc.) on the page can also be loaded via https to get round mixed content warnings, as the site is effectively one large JS app this could be a non trivial process (hard to tell without some investigation).\r\n\r\nSo, if you are able to liaise with IPsoft, BT and Akamai to get the certificate installed we should be able to do the rest.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/09/20 14:07:10 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"As a follow up to this one and in particular with regard to items 2/ and 3/, our understanding is that the only way to have:\r\n -

are you expecting a larger number of people to be accessing the CMS without access to Firefox over the next 10 months or so; and is the suggestion of refactoring the page likely to be a solution that you are interested in?\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":false,"author_id":3640926}],"nice_id":2178,"initially_assigned_at":"2010/12/03 11:46:45 +0000","field_110059":"","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:51 +0000","permissions":{},"problem_id":null,"resolution_time":null,"priority_id":2,"current_tags":"billable facebook level_0 none_required twitter","assignee_id":3640926,"updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:43:40 +0000","req_name":"Zara Rabinowicz","linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2011/07/12 16:37:11 +0100","solved_at":null,"original_recipient_address":null,"field_147056":"billable","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/11/08 15:43:40 +0000","channel":null,"via_id":4,"subject":"Issues with Picture deletion and uploading in the CMS","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","group_id":61946,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:56 +0000","updated_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:56 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:46:45 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/11 11:58:10 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"2"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:57 +0000","updated_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:57 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:56 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/25 11:11:48 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"billable"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:56 +0000","updated_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:56 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:46:45 +0000","updated_at":"2011/07/11 11:31:22 +0100","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"1"},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:46:45 +0000","updated_at":"2011/07/11 11:31:22 +0100","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:57 +0000","updated_at":"2011/07/11 11:31:32 +0100","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:57 +0000","updated_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:57 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2010/12/03 11:31:57 +0000","updated_at":"2011/07/11 11:31:32 +0100","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/01/25 11:11:48 +0000","updated_at":"2011/01/25 11:11:48 +0000","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/07/11 11:31:22 +0100","updated_at":"2011/07/11 11:31:22 +0100","ticket_id":26012712,"value":"0"}],"score":40,"submitter_id":20967651,"base_score":40,"latest_recipients":"support+id2178@postcms.zendesk.com Tom.Price-Stephens@london2012.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":"Liz Goulding, Tom Price Stephens","status_id":2,"description":"Hi\n\nI'm trying to add in new images to the Sports pages, and delete the existing mascot pictures and replace them with smaller thumbnails.\nWhen I click delete the page dimensions change, and when I click insert, no image appears.\n\nHave enclosed screen grabs to demo this.\n\nCheers\nZara\n\nZara Rabinowicz\nAssistant New Media Producer\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\nSwitchboard: +44 (0) 203 2012 000\nwww.london2012.com\nwww.facebook.com/london2012\nwww.twitter.com/london2012","organization_id":40584,"assignee_name":"Danny Sofer","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":20967651},{"comments":[{"created_at":"2010/11/18 12:36:18 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"\"it is always preferable to include a page’s primary keywords in a title tag, and considering the site’s poor ranking for Olympic- related keywords in the United States, it is vital to improve the title tag.\"\r\n\r\n\"Home Page Title Tag Recommendation: London 2012 Olympic Games Official Website | London2012.com\"\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/11/18 12:36:43 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Liz to decide what the rules should be.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2010/11/22 12:17:34 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Due date set as Jan 31.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/06/29 10:49:53 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Liz, I have done another sweep of tickets this morning and spotted this one.
