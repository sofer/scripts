However, when selecting 'Paralympic Seven-a-side' from the sport drop-down list, the venue is displayed as the 'Riverbank Arena'.

I've added the contents of the tickets below.\n\nFirst ticket\n\n\"Hi Service Desk\n\nI am doing a little work and using the London 2012 Completion schedules and the Olympic schedule still has the Handball Arena named as the 'Olympic Park-Handball Arena' and lists no sports competitions when selected.\n\nHowever, when selecting 'Handball' from the sport drop-down list, the venue is displayed as the 'Copper Box'.\n\nThis will confuse the public, and I believe should be listed in the venue drop-down selections for both Olympic and Paralympic venues as the 'Copper Box'?\n\nRegards,\n\nAndy\"\n\nSecond Ticket\n\n\"Hi Service Desk\n\nThe same applies for the Hockey Centre, which should be the Riverbank Arena.\n\nGoing through the Competition schedules the Olympic and Paralympic schedules still have the Hockey Centre named as the 'Hockey Centre' and lists no sports competitions when selected. However, when selecting 'Paralympic Seven-a-side' from the sport drop-down list, the venue is displayed as the 'Riverbank Arena'. This will confuse the public, and i believe should be listed in the venue drop-down selections for both Olympic and Paralympic venues as the 'Riverbank Arena'?\n\nAndy\"\n\nThanks,\n\nDarren Daley\nTechnology Service Delivery\nInternet Delivery Coordinator\nDirect Dial: +44 (0)30 2012 0652\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd\n1 Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5LN\nSwitchboard: +44 (0)20 3 2012 000\nlondon2012.com<http://www.london2012.com/>\n\nP<http://blog.london2012.comp/> Please consider the environment before printing this email\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

This would require either the load balancer, or t Akamai to map port external:443->internal:442.\r\n\r\n 2. Make web01,02,05 listen on two IP addresses. Apache would listen on CurrentIP:443 for the www site, and NewIP:443 for the festival site.\r\n\r\n 3. (As mentioned at the start of the email) get a *.london2012.com certificate. Name-based VirtualHosts can then be used.

As per conversation with Jamie, we think all that is required is for Campbell in the Ceremonies team to update the dates which are fed into the system on his end. That should then update the dates offered to users to select from on the phase 2 form. Does that sound right?\n\nTheir other requirement is  to uncheck the 'Stage 2 complete' box for people who failed to show to auditions, so the Ceremonies team can email them to invite them to choose another audition slot. I assume we need to supply you with a list of those people or their Ids so you can do this?\n\nAlso NB: there are some changes required to the Olympic form to repurpose it for the Paralympic ceremonies on 9 Jan; I'll send these changes through separately.\n\nThanks!\nMorag\n\n\n\nMorag Reavley\nSenior New Media Manager\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\n1 Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon\nDirect dial: 020 32012 160\nReception: 020 32012 000\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

That should then update the dates offered to users to select from on the phase 2 form. Does that sound right?\n\nTheir other requirement is  to uncheck the 'Stage 2 complete' box for people who failed to show to auditions, so the Ceremonies team can email them to invite them to choose another audition slot.

The news on the home page is actually a separate include (see attached). \n\nPublishing the homepage doesn't re-publish the include.\n\nAlthough publishing the new article /should/ publish the include (we looking at why that didn't happen)\n\nAnyway, it's appearing now..\nhttp://www.london2012.com/index.php\n\n2) i think the reason the Local Leaders section has broken links is that some of that section was deliberately held back on the staging server at Morag's request.\n\nThe CMS has no way of knowing which pages have been held back on staging (as it is outside of the CMS and instead is part of the hosting setup) hence the broken links (as far as the CMS is concerned the page you are linking to is live and published).\n\nThe staging server isn't and was never intended to serve this purpose, it was simply to test out changes existing pages or hold back brand new sections before they got pushed live.\n\nIf you do use the staging server in this way ie. ask us to hold back individual pages/sections, if those pages are subsequently published you can't link to them from other pages in the CMS or else you'll end up with broken links.\n\nIn short holding parts of the site back on the staging server in this way leads to problems, especially it pages are held back for extended periods of time and/or mixed in with live pages.\n\nThe best way to handle pre-publish / preview is simply to not publish the pages and view then in the CMS via the preview button.\n\nIf the Local Leaders section is ready to go live now, we can remove an syncing-block (on staging) re-publish all the pages in that section, which should solve any issues with broken links.\n\nShould we do that? can we publish all the pages the /get-involved/local-leaders/ section?\n\nJamie\n\n\n\n\nScreen shot 2012-02-10 at 16.13.44.png","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2012/02/10 17:12:33 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hi Jamie,\n\nI think Morag may now have spoken to you about this.

Currently most pages on London2012.com don't pull through the right details on Facebook posts. We usually get the page title and a vaguely relevent meta description (which is fine, as these can be edited anyway) but the only thumbnail that ever gets to be pulled through (if any) is our permanant advertising banner that is site wide. If tou look at the attachment to this message you'll see it's currently pulling in the 'get ready to celebrate' banner from our site which has nothing to do with the page we're linking to.\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure whey you're asking me for those details? Do you need that for every single page on the site if we want this to work site wide rather than just on the Local Leaders pages? That'll be a seriously big task. Is there no way to code the page so that Facebook gives users the choice of using any image on the page as a thumbnail? I don't know if you remember the old homepage of the Festival site (at www.london2012.com/festival which was a grid of lots of different images. Facebook used to give you the option to cycle through any of those images and choose which one went into the post (this post from a few months back is an example of that. The thumbnail was taken directly from www.london2012.com/festival, which you'll see is linked in the post: http://www.facebook.com/london2012festival#!/london2012festival/posts/131481493602063\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3734551},{"created_at":"2012/01/18 16:37:26 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Thoughts on the above, folks?\r\n\r\nPS - I found this in an old ticket that closed because it got old...\r\n\r\n\"Probably the correct way to solve this issue is to use Facebook's Open Graph Protocol: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/ \r\n\r\nThis would not mean changing the facebook code at all, but it would mean adding code to the header of the page.\r\nWe could probably add a single \"<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"http://www.london2012.com/some-image.jpg\"/>\" to the top of all pages. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could probably allow the content of this tag to be specified page by page, but this would add an extra layer of editorial effort and require a bit of coding.\r\n\r\nThe simplest approach would be a single new metatag to be added to all pages which could possibly be done in under a day (almost all of which would be confirming this approach will work, testing and deployment, rather than actual development).\r\n\r\nOther approaches would take more time, depending on what we actually ended up doing.\"\r\n\r\nI don't think a one-size-fits-all approach to the metadata that's pulled into Facebook will work, it needs to be context specific.

Responses to your responses are below. A couple of things first though:\n\n\n1) I’ve lost track of your thoughts on if / when we could add ‘Like’ (Facebook share) ‘tweet’ (Twitter) etc buttons to the body of individual Local Leaders pages. So e.g. on this page: http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/local-leaders/line-the-streets/ the ‘Like’ / ‘tweet’ buttons will pre-populate with info about Line The Streets and a link back to the page. I know that Twitter allows you to easily generate the code for the ‘tweet’ button, and I’m thinking that the work we’re doing sorting out Facebook ‘Like’ share functionality metadata at the moment should help us get that button sorted too?\n\n2) The first pages we’d like to manually enter the metadata to appear in ‘Like’ share posts on Facebook will be for Local Leaders.

As I understand it these products are going to have their own pages soon and the Local Leaders team want to embed clearly branded 'Like' and 'Tweet' buttons into the body of each page. They also want to make sure that\n\n\na)      The resulting pre-populated Facebook and Twitter posts contain more specific copy than just e.g. the page title. See here: http://mascot-games.london2012.com/#/customiser for where we achieved this for the mascot site (share buttons for Twitter and Facebook are in the bottom right)\n\nb)      An appropriate thumbnail is pulled through on the Facebook post.\n\nI know this raises a few issues that we've discussed previously:\n\n\n1)      Can we resolve this Facebook thumbnail issue? Forgive the repetition as I know Danny in particular has explained the issue to me previously and we've put the idea of fixing it on hold. It would be great if you could remind me and give Tom an idea of what it would take to resolve this?\n\n2)      Ditto re: how much we can customise the copy the content that is pre-populated into Twitter / Facebook posts.\n\nThe final question is can you please give me some estimates of how long it would take to do the work required (if possible?).
