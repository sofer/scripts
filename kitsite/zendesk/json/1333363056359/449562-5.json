The only thing that *really* need to be made secure is the transmission of data from the form to the CMS once it is posted off. \n\n## I know you have very strict data protection requirements, but I would personally question how personal this data actually is?

I seem to remember Dom saying that the origin server did need a cert installed even if just a self signed one). If this is the case then we'd need to figure out who is to complete this work IPSoft or ourselves. This would need installing on stage03/04 and web01-06. \n\nAlthough I do wonder, in light of everything now sitting behind Akamai whether it would make sense to install a self signed wildcard cert (no reason for a proper one as no one will see it) on stage03/04 and web01-06 so that those servers are setup to handle any sub sites under the london2012.com domain.\n\nProbably best Danny if you liaise with Russ on this / schedule any work in.\n\nthanks\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/08/31 18:28:47 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Thanks Jamie – did not mean to go direct to Danny on this when you had given such a comprehensive answer.\n\nRuss\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":14724144},{"created_at":"2011/08/31 18:39:00 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":4,"value":"Hi Russ,\n\nNo, I just meant could Danny (who was cc'd in) pick this ticket back up to figure out a schedule / thrash out the details with you for getting this work done.\n\nNot that Danny is my PA ;-) It's just that he has a better overall picture of our availability and probably has more time than me this week to discuss the finer details with yourself and Akamai.\n\nthanks\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/09/05 11:34:28 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Russ, regarding Jamie's list of tasks added in July:\r\n\r\n1/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to generate a CSR (certificate signing request) for festival.london2012.com \r\n2/ LOCOG need to order a SSL certificate using that CSR (for use on web01-06) \r\n3/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to instal the certificates on web01-06 \r\n4/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to update the Apache httpd.conf on web01-06 \r\n5/ Kitsite need to add a rule to each Apache httpd.conf to redirect form traffic to https and non-form traffic back to http \r\n6/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to restart all web servers \r\n7/ Kitsite need to update the HTML/JS to link to a https version of the signup form and the accessible version of the form [need to work out scope of those changes as the form is submitted via AJAX] \r\n8/ We also need to check that every other asset (image, js, css etc.) on the page can also be loaded via https to get round mixed content warnings, as the site is effectively one large JS app this could be a non trivial process (hard to tell without some investigation).\r\n\r\nI can confirm that this is where responsibility lies:\r\n\r\n1/ ipsoft need to generate a CSR (certificate signing request) for festival.london2012.com \r\n2/ LOCOG need to order a SSL certificate using that CSR (for use on web01-06) \r\n3/ ipsoft need to instal the certificates on web01-06 \r\n4/ Kitsite need to update the Apache httpd.conf on web01-06 \r\n5/ Kitsite need to add a rule to each Apache httpd.conf to redirect form traffic to https and non-form traffic back to http \r\n6/ ipsoft need to restart all web servers\r\n7/ Kitsite need to update the HTML/JS to link to a https version of the signup form and the accessible version of the form [need to work out scope of those changes as the form is submitted via AJAX] \r\n8/ We also need to check that every other asset (image, js, css etc.) on the page can also be loaded via https to get round mixed content warnings, as the site is effectively one large JS app this could be a non trivial process (hard to tell without some investigation).\r\n\r\nSo, if you are able to liaise with IPsoft, BT and Akamai to get the certificate installed we should be able to do the rest.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2011/09/20 14:07:10 +0100","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"As a follow up to this one and in particular with regard to items 2/ and 3/, our understanding is that the only way to have:\r\n -

It returns a server 500 error (basically an internal error of some sort). Beyond that we have no means of establishing what the problem is. I think I send you an email regarding them, which you forwarded to Patrick, moderately recently. Did he/AL get back to you?\r\n\r\nRegarding the \"in progress\" files, those are simply the filenames that are returned to us by the AL API. I asked them about them before, and was told (along the lines of) don't worry about them, they get created internally for [some reason].\r\n\r\nIn short I don't think the large number of in-progresses is anything to worry about, but I would like to get to the bottom of the server 500's if possible.\r\n\r\nKieran","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2012/02/08

I'm just checking - are you saying that the XML files that you've\nbeen returning to us contain more than one <document/> element? If so then\nthat certainly won't work, as the resulting document would not be valid XML\n(as it would contain more than on root node). We can refactor our feed so\nthat it can deal with multiple <document/> elements in one file but it will\nalso require some development work at our end, and at your end - to make the\nXML files valid by wrapping them in a - name-to-be-decided - root element.\n\nPlease can you clarify how you uploaded the batch-in-question, and how this\ndiffered from the hitherto-working process.\nShould \"Job/File/completed\" have returned them all individually?\n\nThanks, in advance,\n\nKieran\n\n\nOn Tue, May 24, 2011 at 11:26 AM, Patrick Gardiner (Applied Language) <\npatrick.gardiner@appliedlanguage.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi Kieran,\n>\n> As per my earlier emails these files were all uploaded last weekend - it\n> may be that they are still listed as in progress on the API as, following\n> your advice, I have been uploading multiple files under one enquiry number\n> (enquiry numbers are our six digit identifier) in order to save time.\n>\n> Do I now need to upload these files again?\n>\n> Kind regards,\n>\n> Patrick Gardiner\n> Service Delivery Manager\n> patrick.gardiner@appliedlanguage.com\n> Skype ID: patrick.gardiner1\n> Tel: +44 (0)844 888 7241\n>\n> Applied Language Solutions\n> High quality language solutions delivered on time...with a smile!\n>\n> www.appliedlanguage.com\n> Tel (UK): +44 (0)845 367 7000\n> Tel (US): +1 (800) 579-5010\n>\n> Riverside Court, Huddersfield Road, Delph, Oldham, OL3 5FZ.

Any/all files that are listed in this response, it then\ndownloads and pushes into the CMS and thus onto the website.\nI don't know what you mean by \"uploading multiple files under one enquiry\nnumber\". Is this a billing terminology? Or does it mean that we should amend\nour feed to work in a different fashion?\nPut simply, if \"Job/File/completed\" returns it, we download and import it.\n\nUnless... I'm just checking - are you saying that the XML files that you've\nbeen returning to us contain more than one <document/> element? If so then\nthat certainly won't work, as the resulting document would not be valid XML\n(as it would contain more than on root node). We can refactor our feed so\nthat it can deal with multiple <document/> elements in one file but it will\nalso require some development work at our end, and at your end - to make the\nXML files valid by wrapping them in a - name-to-be-decided - root element.\n\nPlease can you clarify how you uploaded the batch-in-question, and how this\ndiffered from the hitherto-working process.\nShould \"Job/File/completed\" have returned them all individually?\n\nThanks, in advance,\n\nKieran\n\n\nOn Tue, May 24, 2011 at 11:26 AM, Patrick Gardiner (Applied Language) <\npatrick.gardiner@appliedlanguage.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi Kieran,\n>\n> As per my earlier emails these files were all uploaded last weekend - it\n> may be that they are still listed as in progress on the API as, following\n> your advice, I have been uploading multiple files under one enquiry number\n> (enquiry numbers are our six digit identifier) in order to save time.\n>\n> Do I now need to upload these files again?\n>\n> Kind regards,\n>\n> Patrick Gardiner\n> Service Delivery Manager\n> patrick.gardiner@appliedlanguage.com\n> Skype ID: patrick.gardiner1\n> Tel: +44 (0)844 888 7241\n>\n> Applied Language Solutions\n> High quality language solutions delivered on time...with a smile!\n>\n> www.appliedlanguage.com\n> Tel (UK): +44 (0)845 367 7000\n> Tel (US): +1 (800) 579-5010\n>\n> Riverside Court, Huddersfield Road, Delph, Oldham, OL3 5FZ.
