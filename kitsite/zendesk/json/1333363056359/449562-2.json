As these are not particularly SEO-friendly, pages can\nalso be assigned an SEO-path. The client is NOT served a redirect, the path\nis rewritten on the server. These are contained in SEO.csv, attached.\n\n\"Marketing\" redirects: Paths that are shortened for ease-of-remembering\n(e.g. for advertising campaigns). A permanent redirect is served. These are\ncontained in Marketing.csv, attached. Note that a few of these actually\nredirect to external sites.\n\nAd-hoc redirects/rewrites: Links/paths that have been circulated/published\nerroneously. Plus some paths that have deliberately been changed, but that\nmight have been extensively linked to. Plus some sensible redirects for\ndeleted pages.\nPlus some url-rewrites to generate nicer urls for certain parts of the\nwebsite (for example /path/to/$id => /path/to/file.php/id=$id).\nAs these are more varied than the above rewrites, it is not really possible\nto express them as simple \"X gets mapped to Y\" rules. Therefore I'm\nattaching the relevant Apache configuration directives which you can use or\nignore, depending on requirements. If you need any more information about\nthese rules, please ask me.\n\nKind regards,\n\nKieran","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591},{"created_at":"2012/03/19 12:39:06 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":0,"value":"Marking as solved.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926}],"problem_id":null,"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2012/03/19 12:39:06 +0000","solved_at":"2012/03/19 12:39:06 +0000","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"","field_147056":"capped","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2012/03/05 11:05:21 +0000","via_id":27,"subject":"RE: [PostCMS support] Re: Redirect details request","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"submitter_id":149994292,"base_score":30,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","updated_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","ticket_id":194288507,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2012/03/05 11:05:22 +0000","updated_at":"2012/03/19 12:52:58 +0000","ticket_id":194288507,"value":"0.4"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","updated_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","ticket_id":194288507,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","updated_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","ticket_id":194288507,"value":"capped"},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","updated_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","ticket_id":194288507,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2012/03/05 11:05:22 +0000","updated_at":"2012/03/05 11:05:22 +0000","ticket_id":194288507,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2012/03/05 11:05:22 +0000","updated_at":"2012/03/19 12:39:05 +0000","ticket_id":194288507,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","updated_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","ticket_id":194288507,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","updated_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","ticket_id":194288507,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","updated_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","ticket_id":194288507,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","updated_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","ticket_id":194288507,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2012/03/05 10:43:05 +0000","updated_at":"2012/03/05 11:05:21 +0000","ticket_id":194288507,"value":"1"}],"latest_recipients":"kieran@kitsite.com support+idB2EY-RQQV@postcms.zendesk.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":"Jamie Unwin, Tom Price Stephens","status_id":3,"description":"This is a follow-up to your previous request #7059 \"Redirect details request\"\n\nHi Jamie,\nHope you’re well.

It returns a server 500 error (basically an internal error of some sort). Beyond that we have no means of establishing what the problem is. I think I send you an email regarding them, which you forwarded to Patrick, moderately recently. Did he/AL get back to you?\r\n\r\nRegarding the \"in progress\" files, those are simply the filenames that are returned to us by the AL API. I asked them about them before, and was told (along the lines of) don't worry about them, they get created internally for [some reason].\r\n\r\nIn short I don't think the large number of in-progresses is anything to worry about, but I would like to get to the bottom of the server 500's if possible.\r\n\r\nKieran","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926},{"created_at":"2012/02/08 10:52:41 +0000","attachments":[],"via_id":19,"value":"Ticket #7512 \"RE: FW: London 2012 Translations\" was closed and merged into this ticket.\r\n\r\nLast comment in ticket #7512: Yes, please can you do that?\r\n\r\nFrom: Patrick Gardiner (Applied Language) [mailto:patrick.gardiner@appliedlanguage.com]\r\nSent: 07 February 2012 15:23\r\nTo: Morag Reavley\r\nCc: support@postcms.zendesk.com; gareth.gower@appliedlanguage.com\r\nSubject: Re: FW: London 2012 Translations\r\n\r\nHi Morag,\r\n\r\nI believe we've discussed this before - the error messages and the pending files are not actually pending, - they are requests that were left over when we batched up several files and delivered them in a single request - I can ask the IT dept to delete them if necessary?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nPatrick Gardiner\r\nService Delivery Manager\r\npatrick.gardiner@appliedlanguage.com\r\nSkype ID: patrick.gardiner1\r\nTel: +44 (0)844 888 7241\r\n\r\nApplied Language Solutions\r\nHigh quality language solutions delivered on time...with a smile!\r\n\r\nwww.appliedlanguage.com\r\nTel (UK): +44 (0)845 367 7000\r\nTel (US): +1 (800) 579-5010\r\n\r\nRiverside Court, Huddersfield Road, Delph, Oldham, OL3 5FZ.
