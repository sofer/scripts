While we are happy to try and confirm to / use the same fields as ION is using (if ION get us the fields they are using internally in the few days then we can use those values as a basis when creating out our internal data model / form fields), we are not expecting (at least within the given costs) to build a feed exactly to ION's requirements (for example we will be exporting dates in YYYYMMDD format and will expect the ION system to import the date fields in the format, rather than us exporting dates in a custom format).\n\n b) We will simply be providing a 'export CSV' option in the backend CMS, you can manually export this file and email or FTP this file to ION as often as your like, but each export will contain all previous values, this should be an issue as ION can simply ignore any records they already have entered in tier system.\n\nWe can look at constructing a more tightly coupled integration with ION, but obviously there are additional costs here.\n\n4) Location / City / Town / Place of Birth / Organisation Status\n\nWe are assuming these are free text fields? \n\n5) Getting a copy of the final fields that ION will be using.\n\nIn fact given that these fields will eventually need to be imported by ION it probably makes sense for them to provide us with the database fields and allowed values they are using themselves. \n\nAlthough do be aware that:\n\n a) we will need these values to commence work \n b) any changes to these fields could have significant costs, on top of any CR cost from ION, we will also need to change the form, the data model, the CSV export and (depending on how far along we are) then retest everything.\n\n7) C.2.i \"Please provide the following details of your licence: \" \nDoes this need to be checkboxes or can it just be a drop down (ie. can a user have more than one checked?\n\n8) C.2.ii and B.5.i \"Issuing body (local authority or The Royal Parks):\nI assume the values here are taken form the C column of your spreadsheet? ie. \"Local Authority\" ?\n\n* please be aware that in terms of \"or other please specify.....................\" the other field will be a separate field in our data model and therefore our CSV export ie. we will have a field called \"issuing_body\" and a field named \"issuing_body_other\" which may not entirely match with ION's data model. Although on import it should be fairly simply form them to merge these fields if that is what they required.\n\n9) That \"PART D - DECLARATION\" is not require on the electronic versions, other than a checkbox next to a block of T&C text that is editable by yourselves.\n\nHappy to have a chat though any of this...\n\nI think the most important things in terms of getting the ball rolling are:\n\ni) agreeing on date/time and how that works.\nii) getting the field values that ION are expecting to use (*)\n\n(*) as I have said above we can't guarantee (within the given budget) that our CSV export will 100% match ION's data model or ideal CSV format, but we will (if we receive them this week) use them as a basis for constructing our data model meaning that only the smallest manipulation will need to be done by IOn when importing our CSV export. \n\nthanks\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]}],"channel":null,"updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":66963456},{"nice_id":5188,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/09/29 10:41:36 +0100","field_110059":"4","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:08 +0100","problem_id":null,"resolution_time":null,"priority_id":3,"current_tags":"4 pages","assignee_id":3690996,"updated_at":"2011/11/08 15:47:24 +0000","req_name":"Andy Watkins","linkings":[],"ticket_type_id":3,"status_updated_at":"2011/09/29 10:41:36 +0100","solved_at":null,"original_recipient_address":null,"field_147056":"","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2011/11/08 15:47:24 +0000","score":90,"via_id":4,"subject":"Dropdowns on homepage","recipient":"support@postcms.zendesk.com","group_id":61946,"ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","ticket_id":113345538,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/09/28 11:47:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/28 11:47:56 +0100","ticket_id":113345538,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","updated_at":"2011/10/06 11:45:34 +0100","ticket_id":113345538,"value":"4"},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","ticket_id":113345538,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","ticket_id":113345538,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/09/28 11:47:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/28 11:47:56 +0100","ticket_id":113345538,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/09/28 11:47:56 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/28 11:47:56 +0100","ticket_id":113345538,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","ticket_id":113345538,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","ticket_id":113345538,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","ticket_id":113345538,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","ticket_id":113345538,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/09/23 11:08:10 +0100","updated_at":"2011/09/29 10:29:29 +0100","ticket_id":113345538,"value":"0"}],"submitter_id":3640926,"base_score":90,"permissions":{},"latest_recipients":"danny@kitsite.com support@kitsite.com","due_date":null,"current_collaborators":null,"status_id":1,"description":"From: Andy Watkins <Andy.Watkins@london2012.com>\n\n\nAs part of the homepage redesign we’ve added sports dropdown selectors,\nintended primarily to improve our search rankings.

actually have a ticket open which I have been working on a response to.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem is we can't easily dependency track all the pages that use that thumbnail (homepage, venue pages, hub pages etc.) and hence which pages need to be automatically republished. We also have the problem that the image isn't currently replaced / suppressed, only the main page that shows the image and possible links to that page.\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution would probably be a mix of suppression (when a checkbox is checked, we won't return this webcam to hub pages and/or components) but also to replace the image itself (and all the various repurposing / thumbnails of the image) with a holding image, the tricky thing is here is to stop the feed overwriting the 'holding image' when it next runs.\r\n\r\nIn short, the above is not something we can get in place this afternoon although we can try and push forward the priority on this work.\r\n\r\nYou should however be able suppress the webcam (via the checkbox on the page) and then republish the page, the homepage and hub pages, I think if you do that the webcam will be removed from the hub and homepage.\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\nOn 9 Sep 2011, at 13:39, Tom Price-Stephens wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hi Jamie,\r\n>  \r\n> Following up from speaking to Danny,\r\n>  \r\n> There is a chance the webcams will be taken offline today for a number of days (something to do with scaffolding).\r\n>  \r\n> Apparently we have a holding page we can put in the webcam player – something along the lines of “webcam currently unavailable”\r\n>  \r\n> But we also would like to take the webcam option from the homepage?

Yes\n- Other than the role specific question above, I can't see any fields that depend on the answers to previous fields, but can I just check this is correct? Yes – depending on role you select this determines which questions you get for 1 and/or two but this is the only dependent field.\n- Can we assume that the fields will be fixed / agreed and will not change post us starting work? or that if they are you are prepared for possibly significant additional costs / delays. If we are aware before speccing the work that text may change then we can look making this process more manageable, but obviously it will cost more to build that flexibility into the system. – no once we are live they will be fixed\n\nRegarding the backend, obviously the easier it is to use the better. My main requirement will be to be able to print off the applications to take to interview (so all the information is easy to read in the interview) and to do analysis to make sure an organisation hasn’t applied more than once for the same role, report on the number of roles they have applied for, look at the number of applications per role. Other solutions we are evaluating are cheap but have quite basic backend functionality e.g. using adobe forms. It would be great if you could cost with a csv backend but also something a bit more sophisticated with tabs.\nDo you know how long it will take you to get a view on costs, I am really keen to make a decision by the end of the week as I know we are running short of time.\n\nIf it is easier to chat about any of these requirements please do not hesitate to call me on 02032012656.\n\nThanks\nJess\n\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/07/06 10:26:03 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Speak to you post 5\n\nEnjoy the training :)\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/07/13 12:20:08 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Hi Morag,\r\n\r\nJust wanted to pick this back up, I know we had 90% of a conversation on it but kind of forgot if I was waiting on any info back from yourself or Jess or if you we're waiting on me.\r\n\r\nShould I go ahead and create a proposal based on your requirements and our understanding of how we would implement them, with that level of time/budget?

Ceremonies; in that if from the outset we had knew the form was going to get more complex, much like Ceremonies, we may have suggested a different route / approach; indeed as we have only just started on this piece of work that is still an option; I will discuss internally). \n\nMuch as I don't like to turn work down. I do wonder if (we can't go down the Rails route) it is better to just say no now in order to stem any further feature creep on a piece of work that is already fairly tight on timescale and already a large single page form. The biggest danger / risk / problem with all these data capture projects is flux or creep around the fields that need to be captured (inevitable to some extent, as more people are aware of the project and want the form to capture data pertinent to them, but equally a risk in terms of regression and errors creeping in / deadlines being missed).\n\nThat said we haven't gone so far that it would be a massive disruption to add the extra fields at this stage, although I would question whether you can have a form this long on one page without a 'save' option and therefore it may be worth quickly deciding if we would be better off re-scoping the project as a Rails app with a 4 stage / page form, that can be saved at any stage (although lack of lead time - to allow BTS to agree to us using a hosted Rails server - rather than development time is probably the biggest hurdle in a late change in architecture/approach; )\n\nCan I also check the client is OK with this just living on a standard Games maker template, we haven't costed for any kind of complex design work above the standard form layout and page look and feel. We were thinking along the lines of the accessible volunteer form.\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3686603,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/03 12:38:30 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Thanks, Jamie.\n\nMy feeling is that we say ‘no’ to any form amplification, for the reasons of a) time b) added complexity to the form c) the requirement to have to save the form (which I think would be key, given there are two people involved here).\n\nPage design – I think the basic GM form is fine. If we did something more designed we would use a separate budget and could use a separate designer for page layout, but I think the issue is time. I’m assuming there isn’t time to get a third party to do any html production (when would you need it for)?\n\nMorag\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3692462,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/12 17:35:52 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Due: september 22.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/12 17:58:47 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"See attached.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3640926,"attachments":[{"size":253619,"created_at":"2011/08/12 17:58:25 +0100","content_type":"application/pdf","token":"3eblviv1opflvxs","id":59843322,"filename":"LOCOG_-_Young_Games_Maker_application_v2.pdf","is_public":true,"url":"http://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/3eblviv1opflvxs/?name=LOCOG_-_Young_Games_Maker_application_v2.pdf"}]},{"created_at":"2011/08/15 16:30:30 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Meeting on Tuesday at 9am to review the above, mock ups and a couple of minor changes around data drop downs.","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":51647622,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/08/15 16:42:58 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Wording for the application form introduction (main landing page) :\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for choosing to apply to the Young Games Maker programme.

An option for Technology/Paralympics/Excel should be included in the drop down which i omitted, this should have the same technology specific questions as the other technology opportunities.\n\nPlease could you let me know if this can be fixed today?\n\nMany thanks in advance\nJess\n\n","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":88869087,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/09/30 15:40:36 +0100","via_id":0,"value":"Jessica.\r\n\r\nThe defect was fixed earlier today.

However, the \"apostrophe fix\" appears (given the issue you raised) not to work in \"SharePoint\".\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I don't have any experience of SharePoint, but I would suggest that it might be an idea to do something approximating:\r\n\r\n 1. Select the entire column containing the telephone numbers.\r\n 2. Find the menu item, or control button that that allows you to specify the \"display format\" (possibly known as \"field format\").\r\n 3. Select a display format of \"text\", or \"unformatted\", or \"raw text\" / other. Basically you're looking for a format that ISN'T a number type.\r\n\r\nThe problem incidentally is that spreadsheet software treats fields as numbers by default. This means that the following issues arise when displaying fields containing telephone numbers:\r\n 1. Leading \"0\"s are omitted (as they're redundant when displaying numbers).\r\n 2. When the field reaches a certain length (i.e. over about 10 digits) numbers get displayed in scientific notation (e.g. 2.5234+E11).\r\nYou don't want either of these behaviours for telephone numbers, so you need to tell SharePojnt that these fields are NOT numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please ask, but bear in mind that I don't have a copy of SharePoint so I can't answer SharePoint-related questions with any authority!\r\n\r\nI hope this helps,\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nKieran","type":"Comment","is_public":true,"author_id":3663591,"attachments":[]},{"created_at":"2011/11/09 12:29:29 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Thanks Kieran\n\nI have adapted your process for Windows based Excel asked the HR team to see if that works for them.\n\nI have added to export changes to Current section of Pivotal.
