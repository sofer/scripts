As an action like that could cause a huge number of redirects being written out. If you do need to rename sections with may sub-pages it may be better to use a single regular expression based mod_rewrite (or equivalent server side redirect) rule in a server config.\n\nThe other important thing to check here is that your CMS tracks all the previous redirects in such a way that they all point to a single canonical 'current' url, as opposed to them chaining, or else you may end up with \"to many redirect' errors.\n\nWe also implement what we term 'SEO urls'\nThese are less 'redirects' in the 301 sense and more 'neat' short urls (ie. /basketball) that are inserted into href tags by the CMS instead of the full path to the page (ie. /sport/basketball.php). With these pages the name of the 'short' name of page stays the same regardless of where it lives in the site structure. However I think this may be more specific to our current CMS implementation which has a strong notion of a hierarchical site structure that mates that of the live site in the editorial interfaces.\nhttps://new2012.kitsite.com/kit/admin/seopaths/\n\nIn terms of how to implement the redirects, that will largely depend on your CMS, but I would say you would want to do this somewhere centrally (ie. a server config, a controller, a global request handler) rather than physically replacing the old pages with a page that does the redirect (otherwise you run the risk of having redirects to redirects).\n\nI hope that answers your questions..\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2012/01/19 09:21:30 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Jamie,\nThanks so much for getting back to me.
