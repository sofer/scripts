Apache would listen on CurrentIP:443 for the www site, and NewIP:443 for the festival site.\r\n\r\n 3. (As mentioned at the start of the email) get a *.london2012.com certificate.

The news on the home page is actually a separate include (see attached). \n\nPublishing the homepage doesn't re-publish the include.\n\nAlthough publishing the new article /should/ publish the include (we looking at why that didn't happen)\n\nAnyway, it's appearing now..\nhttp://www.london2012.com/index.php\n\n2) i think the reason the Local Leaders section has broken links is that some of that section was deliberately held back on the staging server at Morag's request.\n\nThe CMS has no way of knowing which pages have been held back on staging (as it is outside of the CMS and instead is part of the hosting setup) hence the broken links (as far as the CMS is concerned the page you are linking to is live and published).\n\nThe staging server isn't and was never intended to serve this purpose, it was simply to test out changes existing pages or hold back brand new sections before they got pushed live.\n\nIf you do use the staging server in this way ie. ask us to hold back individual pages/sections, if those pages are subsequently published you can't link to them from other pages in the CMS or else you'll end up with broken links.\n\nIn short holding parts of the site back on the staging server in this way leads to problems, especially it pages are held back for extended periods of time and/or mixed in with live pages.\n\nThe best way to handle pre-publish / preview is simply to not publish the pages and view then in the CMS via the preview button.\n\nIf the Local Leaders section is ready to go live now, we can remove an syncing-block (on staging) re-publish all the pages in that section, which should solve any issues with broken links.\n\nShould we do that? can we publish all the pages the /get-involved/local-leaders/ section?\n\nJamie\n\n\n\n\nScreen shot 2012-02-10 at 16.13.44.png","type":"Comment","attachments":[{"size":84914,"created_at":"2012/02/10 16:27:33 +0000","content_type":"image/png","token":"ipl9gj7kinuw8rk","id":105196103,"url":"https://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/ipl9gj7kinuw8rk/?name=Screen_shot_2012-02-10_at_16.13.44.png","filename":"Screen_shot_2012-02-10_at_16.13.44.png","is_public":true}],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2012/02/10 17:12:33 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Jamie,\n\nI think Morag may now have spoken to you about this.

Currently most pages on London2012.com don't pull through the right details on Facebook posts. We usually get the page title and a vaguely relevent meta description (which is fine, as these can be edited anyway) but the only thumbnail that ever gets to be pulled through (if any) is our permanant advertising banner that is site wide. If tou look at the attachment to this message you'll see it's currently pulling in the 'get ready to celebrate' banner from our site which has nothing to do with the page we're linking to.\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure whey you're asking me for those details? Do you need that for every single page on the site if we want this to work site wide rather than just on the Local Leaders pages? That'll be a seriously big task. Is there no way to code the page so that Facebook gives users the choice of using any image on the page as a thumbnail? I don't know if you remember the old homepage of the Festival site (at www.london2012.com/festival which was a grid of lots of different images. Facebook used to give you the option to cycle through any of those images and choose which one went into the post (this post from a few months back is an example of that.

Responses to your responses are below. A couple of things first though:\n\n\n1) I’ve lost track of your thoughts on if / when we could add ‘Like’ (Facebook share) ‘tweet’ (Twitter) etc buttons to the body of individual Local Leaders pages. So e.g. on this page: http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/local-leaders/line-the-streets/ the ‘Like’ / ‘tweet’ buttons will pre-populate with info about Line The Streets and a link back to the page. I know that Twitter allows you to easily generate the code for the ‘tweet’ button, and I’m thinking that the work we’re doing sorting out Facebook ‘Like’ share functionality metadata at the moment should help us get that button sorted too?\n\n2) The first pages we’d like to manually enter the metadata to appear in ‘Like’ share posts on Facebook will be for Local Leaders. If I get that info for you now can we get it added to the pages ASAP\n\n3) Responses to your responses\n\n\nLars said:\nI think maybe its best to pick pages maybe via google analytics that make sense to have a meta-desctiption and check them manually?\n\nFC - I agree, will arrange this.\n\nLars said: Also! I think for pages that have a lat-lon location set in the page meta-data ( as i think most of the sport-locations have this ) i think we should include this data in the facebook og:data as well. What you think?\n\nFC - Don’t see why not, good shout\n\nLars said: Also 2! Same for videos, shall we use the opengraph video tags on video pages?\n\nFC – What will this do? Not familiar with it...\n\nLars said: I am currently working on the image resizing.\n\nFC – How’s this going?\n\n\n\n\n\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3734551},{"created_at":"2012/01/25 15:37:30 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Hey Finn, \r\n\r\nThis sounds all good to me, i don't see a problem with the facebook / twitter integration and we can get working and test 1)  and 2) there straight away so lets get it on.\r\n\r\n~ Lets do the others after\r\n\r\nRe image resizing, this went alright, its just that its currently on preview or staging, hence i could not test it cause facebook won't see them but local leaders will tell us.\r\n\r\nI'll speak to Danny to get some time for this.\r\n\r\nLars","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3690996},{"created_at":"2012/01/25 16:16:18 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Thanks Lars, great news.\n\nShall I get the Local Leaders team to provide the wording they want for their Facebook Like (share) and Tweet for each page then?\n\n\n\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3734551},{"created_at":"2012/01/26 18:57:35 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Any news on timings Lars?\n\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3734551},{"created_at":"2012/01/27 15:20:04 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Hey Finn,\r\n\r\nre: Shall I get the Local Leaders team to provide the wording they want for their Facebook Like (share) and Tweet for each page then?\r\nYes please, that would be great,\r\n\r\nre: timing\r\nhow does tuesday next week sound?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nLars","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2012/01/27 15:47:53 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Ace, thanks Jamie\n\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3734551},{"created_at":"2012/01/27 16:11:33 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Hey Finn, sorry its actually Lars here, just had some password problems am here as jamie temporarily!","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2012/01/31 12:51:52 +0000","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Lars, how’s this coming along?\n\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3734551},{"created_at":"2012/01/31 13:24:55 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Hi Finn, Lars is working on this now.

I am not entirely sure who last installed the www.london2102.com certificate and/or if we are allowed to install them [am trying to find Kieran to ask if he remembers]. Assuming for the moment we can generate the CSR / install the cert for you.\n\n1/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to generate a CSR (certificate signing request) for festival.london2012.com\n2/ LOCOG need to order a SSL certificate using that CSR (for use on web01-06)\n3/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to instal the certificates on web01-06\n4/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to update the Apache httpd.conf on web01-06\n5/ Kitsite need to add a rule to each Apache httpd.conf to redirect form traffic to https and non-form traffic back to http\n6/ Kitsite (or ipsoft) need to restart all web servers\n7/ Kitsite need to update the HTML/JS to link to a https version of the signup form and the accessible version of the form [need to work out scope of those changes as the form is submitted via AJAX]\n8/ We also need to check that every other asset (image, js, css etc.) on the page can also be loaded via https to get round mixed content warnings, as the site is effectively one large JS app this could be a non trivial process (hard to tell without some investigation).\n\nps. one thing to be aware of (before we embark on what is a non trivial amount of work) is that the form itself is served up empty (there is no personal data in an empty form) so there little advantage from a security perspective to serving an empty form that up as a https page (other than a padlock appearing).

I seem to remember Dom saying that the origin server did need a cert installed even if just a self signed one). If this is the case then we'd need to figure out who is to complete this work IPSoft or ourselves.

Any/all files that are listed in this response, it then\ndownloads and pushes into the CMS and thus onto the website.\nI don't know what you mean by \"uploading multiple files under one enquiry\nnumber\". Is this a billing terminology? Or does it mean that we should amend\nour feed to work in a different fashion?\nPut simply, if \"Job/File/completed\" returns it, we download and import it.\n\nUnless... I'm just checking - are you saying that the XML files that you've\nbeen returning to us contain more than one <document/> element? If so then\nthat certainly won't work, as the resulting document would not be valid XML\n(as it would contain more than on root node). We can refactor our feed so\nthat it can deal with multiple <document/> elements in one file but it will\nalso require some development work at our end, and at your end - to make the\nXML files valid by wrapping them in a - name-to-be-decided - root element.\n\nPlease can you clarify how you uploaded the batch-in-question, and how this\ndiffered from the hitherto-working process.\nShould \"Job/File/completed\" have returned them all individually?\n\nThanks, in advance,\n\nKieran\n\n\nOn Tue, May 24, 2011 at 11:26 AM, Patrick Gardiner (Applied Language) <\npatrick.gardiner@appliedlanguage.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi Kieran,\n>\n> As per my earlier emails these files were all uploaded last weekend - it\n> may be that they are still listed as in progress on the API as, following\n> your advice, I have been uploading multiple files under one enquiry number\n> (enquiry numbers are our six digit identifier) in order to save time.\n>\n> Do I now need to upload these files again?\n>\n> Kind regards,\n>\n> Patrick Gardiner\n> Service Delivery Manager\n> patrick.gardiner@appliedlanguage.com\n> Skype ID: patrick.gardiner1\n> Tel: +44 (0)844 888 7241\n>\n> Applied Language Solutions\n> High quality language solutions delivered on time...with a smile!\n>\n> www.appliedlanguage.com\n> Tel (UK): +44 (0)845 367 7000\n> Tel (US): +1 (800) 579-5010\n>\n> Riverside Court, Huddersfield Road, Delph, Oldham, OL3 5FZ.

Any/all files that are listed in this response, it then\ndownloads and pushes into the CMS and thus onto the website.\nI don't know what you mean by \"uploading multiple files under one enquiry\nnumber\". Is this a billing terminology? Or does it mean that we should amend\nour feed to work in a different fashion?\nPut simply, if \"Job/File/completed\" returns it, we download and import it.\n\nUnless... I'm just checking - are you saying that the XML files that you've\nbeen returning to us contain more than one <document/> element? If so then\nthat certainly won't work, as the resulting document would not be valid XML\n(as it would contain more than on root node). We can refactor our feed so\nthat it can deal with multiple <document/> elements in one file but it will\nalso require some development work at our end, and at your end - to make the\nXML files valid by wrapping them in a - name-to-be-decided - root element.\n\nPlease can you clarify how you uploaded the batch-in-question, and how this\ndiffered from the hitherto-working process.\nShould \"Job/File/completed\" have returned them all individually?\n\nThanks, in advance,\n\nKieran\n\n\nOn Tue, May 24, 2011 at 11:26 AM, Patrick Gardiner (Applied Language) <\npatrick.gardiner@appliedlanguage.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi Kieran,\n>\n> As per my earlier emails these files were all uploaded last weekend - it\n> may be that they are still listed as in progress on the API as, following\n> your advice, I have been uploading multiple files under one enquiry number\n> (enquiry numbers are our six digit identifier) in order to save time.\n>\n> Do I now need to upload these files again?\n>\n> Kind regards,\n>\n> Patrick Gardiner\n> Service Delivery Manager\n> patrick.gardiner@appliedlanguage.com\n> Skype ID: patrick.gardiner1\n> Tel: +44 (0)844 888 7241\n>\n> Applied Language Solutions\n> High quality language solutions delivered on time...with a smile!\n>\n> www.appliedlanguage.com\n> Tel (UK): +44 (0)845 367 7000\n> Tel (US): +1 (800) 579-5010\n>\n> Riverside Court, Huddersfield Road, Delph, Oldham, OL3 5FZ.
