I think we should be tagging articles to Culture, Ceremonies and/or Torch Relay and if we need to group them in the navigation then do that there. Is 'Round the UK' really a tag, or just a grouping for articles that don't fit into any of the above categories?\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, tthe reason we are re-using the 'Theme' taxonomy is that, that is the taxonomy also used by other pages on the site including Photos, Videos etc. so if we want related images and videos to tie in with News and Blog pages it doent' make sense to have two taxonomies / tags (unless you want to also re-tag all the photos and videos)\r\n\r\nThe one danger / issue here is where we have News articles that are already tagged to the theme Taxonomy (as obv. we are not differentiating between the new tags and the existing ones).\r\n\r\nIn terms of tagging existing articles, you will need to re-tag News/Blog articles if you want a tag driven navigation, although you probably only need to tag up enough recent articles to fill the navigation (the older articles will still appear under month/year). \r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts, as obviously it would be good to get this piece of work live.\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2011/08/08 14:22:01 +0100","via_id":4,"value":"Hi Jamie,\n\nAre you free to take a call this afternoon.\n\nI think it would be good to chat about this properly as after a meeting last week it seems there are a few things to work through.\n\nThanks,\n\nTom\n\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":25108633},{"created_at":"2011/11/14 12:25:19 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"Reassigned to Jamie, as a reminder to discuss this with Tom this week.

I imagine the question is which uri's / requests will (a) go back to the origin and (b) put load on the server. I think Luckit is a slight red herring here, surely what is important is protecting *any* url that may be affected by excessive load or an unnatural burst of requests, for example the Torch Events page actually makes an API call back to Earthware. Yet on pages where we cache the output of a Luckit request the page will present no more load on Apache or Luckit than any other page.\n\nTaking this further, surely 1000 requests from the same IP is suspect regardless of the url being hit, why even limit by url if we are going to turn on request throttling?\n\nI guess that's a long way of saying:\n\n\"Why not apply the same moderate request rate thresholds across all pages? Why single out Luckit pages for throttling?\"\n\"Or is scraping the issue?
