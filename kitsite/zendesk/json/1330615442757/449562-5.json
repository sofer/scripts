Everyone here is delighted with it. There are now a few\nlast things we need to do to complete the site before I leave the ODA\n(in December). \n\nI have outlined the final tasks below. Please can you take a look and\nsend over a quote for this work? I think we will need a quick chat to go\nthrough all of this in detail so that I'm as clear as I can be on what\nwe require - how about Monday?\n\n\n\n1.       Analytics - we are being harassed about measuring the number of\npeople visiting the site, which is absolutely something we should have\nthought about before. What is the cost to build the capacity to measure\nthe number of people visiting the home page? And also another cost for\nthe home page and theme pages? This is quite urgent, so it would be\ngreat to get this set up ASAP.\n\n \n\n2.       Accessibility - there is an issue with the accessibility style\nsheets, as in they don't look great. AbilityNet picked up that the pages\nshould 'render with a layout similar to the normal site, but with bigger\ntext and more contrasting colours'. I know you've advised that doing\nthat would mean effectively designing a new CSS layout/design purely for\nthe accessible versions of each page - please can we get a quote for\nredesigning the accessible versions of the pages? \n\n \n\n3.       Flash plug-in - there is an issue with the London 2012\nlogo/scrolling pictures on the home page in Internet Explorer. I think\nthis is something to do with 'flash plug-ins', as this was the error\nmessage that came up when we loaded the site in Firefox at the ICE.\nPlease can you explore and rectify?\n\n\n\n4.       Alt text on scrolling pictures - we need the alt text to show\nas a yellow box when hovering over the images so that people know where\nthey are. I think you have said this will require a component/function\nadding so may have cost implications. Can we get a quote for this\nplease?\n\n\n\n5.       Archaeology navigation - in order to get the nesting right (to\nmirror the site map) we had to lose the top level menu when you click on\n'The investigations' and 'The sites'. This is not ideal, as it simply\ndoesn't look great. What options do we have to amend/fix this?\n\n\n\n6.       Full list of publications - The project team want us to add an\noption on each theme page for a full list of publications per theme (ie\na list of all micro reports, case studies, champion products and\nresearch summaries for Sustainability). Can we add a link, or another\nbox for this? Would be great to go through the options and costs for\nthis.\n\n\n\n7.       External links page - we would like to add in External Links\nfor each theme page. I reckon there will be around five external\nwebsites for us to link out to, per theme. Maybe this could sit under\nthe 'related links' on the right? Also would be great to discuss\noptions.\n\n \n\n8.       Technical Overviews - we are publishing some technical\noverviews of the project, which are external papers that we just need to\nlink to. Because these are overviews of the project, and not\ntheme-specific, are we able to add a tab at the top, which takes you to\na page about the overviews? It just needs to be a page, with information\nabout three organisations delivering the overviews. \n\n \n\n9.       Case study summaries - there are a number of case studies being\npublished by external organisations next year that we have the\nsummaries/abstracts for. We need these summaries to go on the website\nwith links to the full case studies/publishers. I suggest that these go\nunder the case studies section, or we have another 'box' for case study\nsummaries. However, these aren't documents to upload (as with case\nstudies), so there will be no thumbnail and no physical PDF to link to.\nIt will just need to be a generic image, with the summary/abstract to go\ninto the text box next to the thumbnail, and the link will take you to\nan external website (rather than a PDF). Hope this makes sense? The only\nother catch is that the links won't be available until next year! Best\nto talk through this one!\n\n \n\n10.   LOCOG testing of the website - Colin Miller has been continuing to\ntest the website since we've gone live and has picked up a few\n'aesthetic niggles'. I have asked him to outline what these are and will\nget back to you ASAP. They are not expected to be extensive and I'm\nhoping we can fix these in-house.\n\n \n\n \n\nHope this all makes sense.

Everyone here is delighted with it. There are now a few\nlast things we need to do to complete the site before I leave the ODA\n(in December). \n\nI have outlined the final tasks below. Please can you take a look and\nsend over a quote for this work? I think we will need a quick chat to go\nthrough all of this in detail so that I'm as clear as I can be on what\nwe require - how about Monday?\n\n\n\n1.       Analytics - we are being harassed about measuring the number of\npeople visiting the site, which is absolutely something we should have\nthought about before. What is the cost to build the capacity to measure\nthe number of people visiting the home page? And also another cost for\nthe home page and theme pages? This is quite urgent, so it would be\ngreat to get this set up ASAP.\n\n \n\n2.       Accessibility - there is an issue with the accessibility style\nsheets, as in they don't look great. AbilityNet picked up that the pages\nshould 'render with a layout similar to the normal site, but with bigger\ntext and more contrasting colours'. I know you've advised that doing\nthat would mean effectively designing a new CSS layout/design purely for\nthe accessible versions of each page - please can we get a quote for\nredesigning the accessible versions of the pages? \n\n \n\n3.       Flash plug-in - there is an issue with the London 2012\nlogo/scrolling pictures on the home page in Internet Explorer. I think\nthis is something to do with 'flash plug-ins', as this was the error\nmessage that came up when we loaded the site in Firefox at the ICE.\nPlease can you explore and rectify?\n\n\n\n4.       Alt text on scrolling pictures - we need the alt text to show\nas a yellow box when hovering over the images so that people know where\nthey are. I think you have said this will require a component/function\nadding so may have cost implications. Can we get a quote for this\nplease?\n\n\n\n5.       Archaeology navigation - in order to get the nesting right (to\nmirror the site map) we had to lose the top level menu when you click on\n'The investigations' and 'The sites'. This is not ideal, as it simply\ndoesn't look great. What options do we have to amend/fix this?\n\n\n\n6.       Full list of publications - The project team want us to add an\noption on each theme page for a full list of publications per theme (ie\na list of all micro reports, case studies, champion products and\nresearch summaries for Sustainability). Can we add a link, or another\nbox for this? Would be great to go through the options and costs for\nthis.\n\n\n\n7.       External links page - we would like to add in External Links\nfor each theme page. I reckon there will be around five external\nwebsites for us to link out to, per theme. Maybe this could sit under\nthe 'related links' on the right? Also would be great to discuss\noptions.\n\n \n\n8.       Technical Overviews - we are publishing some technical\noverviews of the project, which are external papers that we just need to\nlink to. Because these are overviews of the project, and not\ntheme-specific, are we able to add a tab at the top, which takes you to\na page about the overviews? It just needs to be a page, with information\nabout three organisations delivering the overviews. \n\n \n\n9.       Case study summaries - there are a number of case studies being\npublished by external organisations next year that we have the\nsummaries/abstracts for. We need these summaries to go on the website\nwith links to the full case studies/publishers. I suggest that these go\nunder the case studies section, or we have another 'box' for case study\nsummaries. However, these aren't documents to upload (as with case\nstudies), so there will be no thumbnail and no physical PDF to link to.\nIt will just need to be a generic image, with the summary/abstract to go\ninto the text box next to the thumbnail, and the link will take you to\nan external website (rather than a PDF). Hope this makes sense? The only\nother catch is that the links won't be available until next year! Best\nto talk through this one!\n\n \n\n10.   LOCOG testing of the website - Colin Miller has been continuing to\ntest the website since we've gone live and has picked up a few\n'aesthetic niggles'. I have asked him to outline what these are and will\nget back to you ASAP. They are not expected to be extensive and I'm\nhoping we can fix these in-house.\n\n \n\n \n\nHope this all makes sense. As suggested, let's catch up early next week\nand then get a lump-sum for all of these changes. I want to ensure that\nwe are very clear from the outset and that you are paid for all the\nextra work you are doing.\n\n \n\nHope you have a lovely weekend.

Where possible we will simple address the issues, indeed we have already address several of the issues highlighted in Ability.net report, but some the larger issues the deliverables will simply be an estimate of work involved.

If not all those links are editable in the CMS so you can just add them in (although as they all have adfarm.mediplex.com urls they will be seen by the CMS as external pages and hence may get 'external link' icons - this is done deep down in the publication layer and isn't easy to change).\n\nHappy to have a chat, although tomorrow would be better than today.\n\nbtw. can you not share your stat data from Google Analytics with TFL rather than us adding yet another set of ad tracking tags to the templates/pages?\n\nJamie","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3686603},{"created_at":"2012/01/17 11:14:10 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"This support ticket has been automatically closed.\r\n\r\nFor support assistance please contact support@kitsite.com\r\nFor general information concerning Kitsite or PostCMS  please contact info@kitsite.com\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nKitsite","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3640926}],"problem_id":null,"organization_id":40584,"field_177410":null,"assignee_name":"Danny Sofer","updated_by_type_id":0,"requester_id":25108633},{"nice_id":4469,"initially_assigned_at":"2011/08/05 12:22:30 +0100","field_358835":"0","field_110059":"","field_97116":"0","entry_id":null,"created_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:19 +0100","resolution_time":4824,"priority_id":0,"current_tags":"files level_0 none_required pages","assignee_id":3640926,"score":20,"updated_at":"2012/02/15 09:38:00 +0000","req_name":"Indy Rihal","ticket_field_entries":[{"ticket_field_id":95936,"created_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","ticket_id":85737266,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":97116,"created_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","updated_at":"2012/01/17 11:13:33 +0000","ticket_id":85737266,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":110059,"created_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","ticket_id":85737266,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":147056,"created_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","ticket_id":85737266,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":148059,"created_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","ticket_id":85737266,"value":""},{"ticket_field_id":177410,"created_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","ticket_id":85737266,"value":null},{"ticket_field_id":358835,"created_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","updated_at":"2012/01/17 11:13:33 +0000","ticket_id":85737266,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":361219,"created_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","updated_at":"2012/01/17 11:13:34 +0000","ticket_id":85737266,"value":"level_0"},{"ticket_field_id":380790,"created_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","ticket_id":85737266,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":381640,"created_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","updated_at":"2012/01/17 11:13:34 +0000","ticket_id":85737266,"value":"none_required"},{"ticket_field_id":440663,"created_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","ticket_id":85737266,"value":"0"},{"ticket_field_id":486619,"created_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","updated_at":"2011/06/30 12:33:20 +0100","ticket_id":85737266,"value":"0"}],"channel":null,"ticket_type_id":1,"status_updated_at":"2012/02/15 09:38:00 +0000","solved_at":"2012/01/17 11:13:34 +0000","original_recipient_address":null,"field_381640":"none_required","field_147056":"","external_id":null,"assigned_at":"2012/01/17 11:13:34 +0000","linkings":[],"via_id":0,"subject":"Interactive map and audio on Learning Legacy site","recipient":null,"organization_name":"London 2012","group_id":61946,"permissions":{},"submitter_id":3640926,"base_score":20,"latest_recipients":null,"due_date":null,"current_collaborators":"Uzma.Khan","status_id":4,"description":"Add audio files (mp3) and an interactive map? \r\n \r\nExample: http://www.framearch.co.uk/t5/interactive-map/\r\n \r\nOne of the themes on the site will be archaeology and this section will be slightly different, with a few more pages.
