Michael,\r\n\r\nThe problem is the PDF itself \r\n\r\n(the CMS in this case is a red herring / unrelated, it's simply used to publish the PDF on the web server, we aren't adding or modifying the PDF in anyway).\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the source document had the meta data of another document (the Tourism Sector one) or the that the tool used to create the PDF still had metadata from a previous conversion. \r\n\r\nIf I view the PDF in a text editor I can actually see the rouge MetaData tag.\r\n<rdf:li xml:lang=\"x-default\">London 2012 Brand Protection: Information for the Tourism Sector</rdf:li>\r\n\r\nIt looks like it's the \"Tittle\" tag in Acrobat (or whatever was used to create the PDF) (see attached screen grab)\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[{"size":107375,"created_at":"2012/02/07 11:06:15

The para returns are not showing on the index page – all the text runs as one.\n\n2. Is it possible to add a break within the text so that not all the text shows on the index page (as per our normal blog)?\n\n3. Can you remind me how we assign a team name / avatar to a blog post – can we just enter them as normal authors i.e. Aberdeen instead of a person’s name? [You did tell me this but I have forgotten...]\n\n4.

The form changes are shown on the attached doc: it's the addition of one new field, plus tweaks to the values in Performance skills (some new values, some removed values). I'm hoping these are not huge. You will\nThe date for go-live is Weds 11 January, but obviously we are still using the phase 1 form for Olympic auditions until the end of Monday. That means these changes would be required to be made and pushed live on Tues, 10 Jan.  Is that possible?\nThe process is:\n\n*         Olympic auditions form closes Monday evening. Application Stage II form is moved offline to a new URL .  The old URL /games/ceremonies/get-involved/ceremonies-application-stage-two.php shows a static \"Thank you but Olympic auditions are now closed\" page.\n\n*         Tuesday - make changes to form as indicated, and change campaign ID (new value tba by Campbell). Test to ensure our system and Campbell's system still talk to each other.\n\n*         Weds - stage 2 form opens with minor changes at a new URL. I suggest / games/ceremonies/get-involved/paralympic-ceremonies-application-stage-two.php\nSome time in February (tba) -  stage II form taken offline and replaced with Static pages\nIs that okay?

Currently kitsite pick up the audition data from with the following URL:\nhttp://www.idlestate.com/show/calls/xml/\nIt would be great if they could change to using:\nhttps://www.london2012ceremonies.com/show/calls/xml\n[It’s secure and for the certificate to work, they will need to use the correct domain name of www.london2012ceremonies.com.]\n\nCan we ensure there is only a Paralympic logo (not an Olympic logo) on the phase 2 form, plus http://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/casting-information.php and http://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/application-process.php and http://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/faqs.php and http://www.london2012.com/games/ceremonies/get-involved/terms-and-conditions.php\n\nThanks!\n\n\n","type":"Comment","attachments":[],"is_public":true,"author_id":3692462},{"created_at":"2012/01/24 10:16:48 +0000","via_id":0,"value":"> can you confirm that Kitsite are now using the SSL URL for the auditions API?\r\nNot yet.
