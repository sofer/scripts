We published another article last week with the same settings.\nUnfortunately, both articles seem to be hidden somewhere and they do not appear on the French News section of the website, right after another article, even if the url works separately. So it seems there is no url problem.\n\nWe noticed also that the only article that appears on the index page was not the same type, that is, “news article” and not “news article fr”. We tried to republish the last article with the “news article” type but it seems it is not the problem.\n\nYou might be right on the second idea you pointed out but how can we make it automatically and update the French index ?\n\nThank you very much\n\nMayra\n\n\n\nFrom: Anne de Faramond\nSent: 16 April 2012 14:53\nTo: Mayra Agudelo\nSubject: FW: [PostCMS support] Re: French website\n\n\n\nFrom: Jamie Unwin [mailto:notifications-support@postcms.zendesk.com]\nSent: 16 April 2012 14:44\nTo: Anne de Faramond\nSubject: [PostCMS support] Re: French websiteFrom: Jamie Unwin [mailto:notifications-support@postcms.zendesk.com]\r\nSent: 16 April 2012 14:44\r\nTo: Anne de Faramond\r\nSubject: [PostCMS support] Re: French website","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":3663591,"created_at":"2012/04/16 16:45:30 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"This ticket was closed and merged into ticket #9106 \"French website\".","via_id":19,"attachments":[]}],"ticket_field_entries":[{"created_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","ticket_field_id":95936,"ticket_id":219269232,"updated_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","ticket_field_id":110059,"ticket_id":219269232,"updated_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","ticket_field_id":147056,"ticket_id":219269232,"updated_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","ticket_field_id":148059,"ticket_id":219269232,"updated_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","ticket_field_id":361219,"ticket_id":219269232,"updated_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","ticket_field_id":380790,"ticket_id":219269232,"updated_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","ticket_field_id":381640,"ticket_id":219269232,"updated_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","ticket_field_id":440663,"ticket_id":219269232,"updated_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","ticket_field_id":486619,"ticket_id":219269232,"updated_at":"2012/04/16 15:18:04 +0100","value":"0"}],"linkings":[]},{"assigned_at":"2012/04/16 13:19:58 +0100","assignee_id":3686603,"assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","base_score":8,"created_at":"2012/04/16 12:53:42 +0100","current_collaborators":null,"current_tags":"authorized billable its upload","description":"Begin forwarded message:\n\n> From: Tom Price-Stephens <Tom.Price-Stephens@london2012.com>\n> Date: 13 April 2012 14:56:07 GMT+01:00\n> To: Jamie Unwin <jamie@kitsite.com>\n> Subject: jamiemaster100112.xlsx\n> \n> Apologies Jamie,\n>  \n> The spreadsheet I sent you earlier was wrong – could we please upload this one,\n> \n> Thanks,\n> \n> TOm\n> \n> \n> The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited \n> A company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819\n> This E-mail is confidential.

The only reason for the staging server is so we can stop syncing and test out significant changes to the site or to the server configuration files. But this is not something we do on a normal day to day basis. In fact there is no way to show events only on the staging server as GDP will need to out the event live so that it will appear in their search API and in turn in our search results.\n\nCan I just check that you aren't doing something in the GDP system that would stop the events being sent to us in the feed and/or appearing in GDP's search results API ?\n\nthanks\n\nJamie","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":3686603,"created_at":"2012/04/12 17:31:53 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"\"The field ‘excluded from feed’ has been ticked in these events as instruction from the events database team so they won’t be live.\"\n\nAh, that would explain the problem...\n\nThat checkbox is doing *exactly* what it says, namely ‘exclud(ing the event) from (the) feed’ which is why we wont' have received it / it won't be appearing on the festival site (staging or live).\n\n* I should reiterate, despite it's name, there is nothing special about the \"staging server\" it does not (without manual intervention) give you the ability to 'stage' or 'preview' an event or page prior to it going live. Furthermore in the case of event pages (as opposed to template or config changes) there is no way of staging an event page, as the very notion of sending it to us from GDP will cause the event to simultaneously appear in the live GDP search results.\n\n** is there no method in GDP's system of previewing an event before it is sent to us? that would the natural/sensible place to preview an event.","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":161948746,"created_at":"2012/04/12 17:32:22 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Thanks, apparently last November events appeared on the staging website without being live..
