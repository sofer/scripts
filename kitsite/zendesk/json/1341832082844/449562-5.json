is a horrible timesink. Page editor is close to unacceptable in IE, especially when trying to deal with rich elements. It has quite a few browser hacks (instead of feature hacks), but I'm afraid it never worked perfectly on IE.

In theory if we could get Michael in for a months he possible could rewrite it, but then I expect we'd end up with another two dozen new issues as a result of doing that).\r\n\r\nLooking at the templates and how we could restructure them so we could use a <content:picture> container is however realistic, although a bit open ended / more a design issue.","via_id":0,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":3640926,"created_at":"2011/06/01 12:26:25 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Zara, apologies for taking so long to get back to you on this one, but this is a somewhat intractable problem, without a realistic timescale. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is another solution which we haven't mentioned: refactoring the page template so that instead of inline images, we place image containers in specific locations on the page. This may even be a better solution than allowing inline images if you are likely to have more people entering content over the next 12 months, because it enforces layout more than adding images inline on an ad hoc basis.\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize, the options are:\r\n\r\n1.

Obviously if these are inbound links from other sites (rather than just links in Googles site index) then that is another matter and we probably do need to match them up.\n\nThe one downside to bulk redirects like this is the server load, as every request will need to first run a check to see if it matches any of those redirects, this may seem insignificant at first, but if we ended up with a couple of thousand redirects that could in turn end up adding a significant load to each request especially which when multiplied up by millions of requests \n\nIf the URL follow a pattern ie. the section name has changed or if any pages in /volunteering should now go to the /volunteer hub we may be able to write a single wildcard redirect which would be more efficient.\n\nSo in short, yes we can, if it's external urls from other sites we should (and can we pattern match any of them en-mass?).

Response from David on the 404 proposal is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have included an export of your Google crawl results and unfortunately we are talking about more like 10,000 URL than 300. This will have a significant impact on how this is approached. I think we need to identify wildcards that would forward with a 301 to some new or higher level directory. I am assuming that most of these 10,000 URL are the result of some old URL structure change where no appropriate 301s where put in place when the changes were rolled out. \r\n\r\nThe primary strategy is to redirect as many of these 404 to the appropriate pages using 301 redirects. The secondary strategy would be to have a smart 404 page for the 404 not caught by our rule set that uses search to provide relevant links to what the user is probably looking for. This smart 404 page is very much (OPTIONAL) and will not be necessary if we think we can catch most of the 404 with a rule set.\"\r\n\r\n(I've attached the list of 404s.)\r\n\r\nCould you take a look and tweak your proposal accordingly - hopefully you'll be able to spot a pattern in the 404 so that rules can be used for the redirects.\r\n\r\nI've not commented on the sitemap part of the document as we're handling that elsewhere now.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAndy","via_id":0,"attachments":[{"content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","created_at":"2011/07/14 17:18:15 +0100","filename":"Web_crawl_errors_www_london2012_com_20110704T032803Z.csv","id":56124981,"is_public":true,"size":1710817,"token":"laeghwbmmsavd1h","url":"https://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/laeghwbmmsavd1h/?name=Web_crawl_errors_www_london2012_com_20110704T032803Z.csv"}]},{"author_id":18087822,"created_at":"2011/08/01 15:44:19 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Hi, realise you're flat out at the moment, but could you let me know when you'll be able to take a look at this?","via_id":0,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":3663591,"created_at":"2011/08/30 11:18:27 +0100","is_public":false,"type":"Comment","value":"I propose the following:\r\n  1. 403's should yield the error page.\r\n  2.

If there are significant gains from adding two-hops over the one-hop I think we should go for two-hops (OPTION 2) but don't recommend going over two hops.","via_id":0,"attachments":[{"content_type":"text/csv","created_at":"2012/01/25 10:04:37 +0000","filename":"Web_crawl_errors_Not_found_www_london2012_com_20120125T100407Z.csv","id":100041461,"is_public":true,"size":666349,"token":"vauxafycbt3hrvj","url":"https://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/vauxafycbt3hrvj/?name=Web_crawl_errors_Not_found_www_london2012_com_20120125T100407Z.csv"}]},{"author_id":3663591,"created_at":"2012/01/25 10:14:29 +0000","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Can I check what you mean by \"hops\"?\n\nAm I correct in thinking that \"one hop only\" means that:\n\n /d1/d2/d3/non-existent-file.php\n\nwould be redirected to:\n\n /d1/d2/d3/\n\nif that folder exists (and it has an index.php) BUT that if that folder\n/didn't/ exist, we would serve a 404, rather than checking for /d1/d2/ or\n/d1/ ?\n\nThanks,\n\nKieran\n\n\n\n\n","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":18087822,"created_at":"2012/01/25 10:15:37 +0000","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Hi Kieran – yes, that’s exactly it.\n\nAndy\n\n","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":3640926,"created_at":"2012/01/31 10:58:02 +0000","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Andy, have we got a final recommendation from David on which option we are going for?","via_id":0,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":18087822,"created_at":"2012/01/31 11:48:21 +0000","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"No, I’m waiting for the reports I requested from Kieran on the 25th.

As these are not particularly SEO-friendly, pages can\nalso be assigned an SEO-path. The client is NOT served a redirect, the path\nis rewritten on the server. These are contained in SEO.csv, attached.\n\n\"Marketing\" redirects: Paths that are shortened for ease-of-remembering\n(e.g. for advertising campaigns). A permanent redirect is served. These are\ncontained in Marketing.csv, attached. Note that a few of these actually\nredirect to external sites.\n\nAd-hoc redirects/rewrites: Links/paths that have been circulated/published\nerroneously. Plus some paths that have deliberately been changed, but that\nmight have been extensively linked to. Plus some sensible redirects for\ndeleted pages.\nPlus some url-rewrites to generate nicer urls for certain parts of the\nwebsite (for example /path/to/$id => /path/to/file.php/id=$id).\nAs these are more varied than the above rewrites, it is not really possible\nto express them as simple \"X gets mapped to Y\" rules. Therefore I'm\nattaching the relevant Apache configuration directives which you can use or\nignore, depending on requirements. If you need any more information about\nthese rules, please ask me.\n\nKind regards,\n\nKieran","via_id":4,"attachments":[{"content_type":"text/csv","created_at":"2012/03/06 11:33:12

It returns a server 500 error (basically an internal error of some sort). Beyond that we have no means of establishing what the problem is. I think I send you an email regarding them, which you forwarded to Patrick, moderately recently. Did he/AL get back to you?\r\n\r\nRegarding the \"in progress\" files, those are simply the filenames that are returned to us by the AL API. I asked them about them before, and was told (along the lines of) don't worry about them, they get created internally for [some reason].\r\n\r\nIn short I don't think the large number of in-progresses is anything to worry about, but I would like to get to the bottom of the server 500's if possible.\r\n\r\nKieran","via_id":19,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":3640926,"created_at":"2012/02/08 10:52:41 +0000","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Ticket #7512 \"RE: FW: London 2012 Translations\" was closed and merged into this ticket.\r\n\r\nLast comment in ticket #7512: Yes, please can you do that?\r\n\r\nFrom: Patrick Gardiner (Applied Language) [mailto:patrick.gardiner@appliedlanguage.com]\r\nSent: 07 February 2012 15:23\r\nTo: Morag Reavley\r\nCc: support@postcms.zendesk.com; gareth.gower@appliedlanguage.com\r\nSubject: Re: FW: London 2012 Translations\r\n\r\nHi Morag,\r\n\r\nI believe we've discussed this before - the error messages and the pending files are not actually pending, - they are requests that were left over when we batched up several files and delivered them in a single request - I can ask the IT dept to delete them if necessary?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nPatrick Gardiner\r\nService Delivery Manager\r\npatrick.gardiner@appliedlanguage.com\r\nSkype ID: patrick.gardiner1\r\nTel: +44 (0)844 888 7241\r\n\r\nApplied Language Solutions\r\nHigh quality language solutions delivered on time...with a smile!\r\n\r\nwww.appliedlanguage.com\r\nTel (UK): +44 (0)845 367 7000\r\nTel (US): +1 (800) 579-5010\r\n\r\nRiverside Court, Huddersfield Road, Delph, Oldham, OL3 5FZ.
