The difference is, the photos appear on the window below. After the change to ‘simple upload’ This time however, I needed to upload ALL photos first on the folder images/backstage. Then I need to create a T3 gallery, search for the photo using the picture icon meaning going thru the folders (then save, refresh, then add another photo).\n\nIn theory, it has been going on like this but now its really a longer process. I have been able to manage before because we didn’t need to create a lot of image galleries but come Festival time, I think this should be resolved.\n\nBest,\n\nTuesday\n\n\n\n","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":3686603,"created_at":"2012/06/08 12:06:42 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Hi Tuesday,\n\nWe're seeing a scroller (see attached screenshot) what browser are you using?\n\nAlso not sure what you mean by \"since uploading has been changed\" we haven't changed the way images are uploaded? \n\n(although I notice you have \"use simple image upload\" checked, which may be what is causing confusion, you should be able yo uncheck this)\n\nSecondly you can upload images/assign images in two ways:\n\n1) Upload your images into a folder and *then* open a page and assign them.\n2) Upload an image and assign an image in one step (inside the page editor)\n\nThe advantage of (1) is you can upload multiple images as a zip file and then easily assign multiple images to a page, I think this is what you want to do.\n\nDo also un-check the \"use simple upload\" checkbox (unless you have this checked for a specific reason, it;s really only there for users who can't use Flash).\n\nJamie\n\n\n\nScreen shot 2012-06-08 at 11.55.41.png","via_id":4,"attachments":[{"content_type":"image/png","created_at":"2012/06/08 12:06:43 +0100","filename":"Screen_shot_2012-06-08_at_11.55.41.png","id":150461067,"is_public":true,"size":248982,"token":"uwqzyl93r7kgyct","url":"https://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/uwqzyl93r7kgyct/?name=Screen shot 2012-06-08 at 11.55.41.png"}]},{"author_id":161948746,"created_at":"2012/06/08 12:11:34 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Ok great thanks, I’ll follow this\n\nBest\n\nTuesday\n\n","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":161948746,"created_at":"2012/06/08 12:12:39 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"I’m using I.E 8\n\nHere’s my screenshot\n\n[cid:image001.jpg@01CD456F.F84CC6C0]\n\n","via_id":4,"attachments":[{"content_type":"image/jpeg","created_at":"2012/06/08 12:12:39 +0100","filename":"image001.jpg","id":151844728,"is_public":true,"size":63020,"token":"eadxj2o0ypwbcxn","url":"https://postcms.zendesk.com/attachments/token/eadxj2o0ypwbcxn/?name=image001.jpg"}]},{"author_id":3686603,"created_at":"2012/06/08 12:27:12 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"No that doesn't look good :-) just checking what has gone on.\n\nJamie","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":161948746,"created_at":"2012/06/08 13:36:24 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Ok thanks\n\nHave you by any chance checked with Kieran on the media bureau plan?

Two points though:\nFirstly, many of those items are very low in the technology stack and - as\nsuch - are items that we don't really have an opinion on.

You'll recall that last\ntime it was performed silently, with no warning, and no notification\nafterwards. If you are happy with this arrangement, then so are we but if\nasked for our opinion, we would say that it would be safer for Kitsite to\nbe informed before and after the migration.\nKind regards,\nKieran","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":146383021,"created_at":"2012/05/28 11:08:52 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"I’ll let you know the date after the Patching meeting tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n<hr width=\"100%\">\r\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\r\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \r\n          \r\nThis E-mail is confidential.

Let people know to use the 'right-click and save as' method to download the file ( easiest ) \r\n2. put the ringtone in a zip file, zip files always open in the \"download file\" dialogue ( easiest, too)\r\n3. open it via php using special headers, means the file stays an mp3 and on click you'll get a download file dialogue.\r\n    ( this does sound the nicest but this also eats up the most time getting it to work / browser testing, also there is a slight chance it might not work )\r\n\r\nI personally like the zip file approach.\r\nLet me know.\r\n\r\nLars","via_id":0,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":161948746,"created_at":"2012/05/18 15:16:05 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Thanks Lars,\n\nKindly unpublish the backstage.

this in the light of all the 'Rump' sites you are managing for us (including ODA ones), so that we have a plan to add a link?\n\nPlease liaise with Tom to agree where this link should go on each site.\n\nThanks!\n\nMorag\n\n*******\n\nAs you may be aware, on 26 May a new EU law comes into effect in the UK concerning use of cookies on websites, mobile sites and mobile apps. London 2012 needs to ensure that all its websites comply with this law, and we are therefore asking you to support these requirements through a small update to the website you manage for us.\n\nThe new law\nIf cookies are used in a site, the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (UK Regulations) provide that certain information must be given to that site's visitors and where possible the user must give his or her consent to the placing of the cookies. This includes all kinds of cookies, including those used for traffic analytics, advertisement, stylesheet management, user profiles and technical management.\n\nFurther information about the scope and scale of this legislation is available at the website of the Information Commissioner's Office: http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies.aspx\n\nHow London 2012 sites must comply\nIt is essential that London 2012 websites comply with this law, as there will be much scrutiny given to how high-profile websites such as ours are meeting the new requirements.\n\nLondon 2012's policy is to make the user aware of our use of cookies as prominently as possible, by clearly signposting users to a master 'Cookies policy' page which will be hosted on the main London 2012 website, www.london2012.com. This page will outline all the cookies featured across all London 2012 sites, and will explain how users can choose to opt out of cookies if they wish to do so.\n\nThe link to the 'Cookies policy' page should feature in the top (hygiene) or footer navigation of your site.  The URL you should use to link to will be www.london2012.com/cookies-policy - NB this page will not be active until Monday, 14 May, so you should time your navigation to be updated at that date. NB it is not sufficient to expand your 'Privacy policy' page to 'Privacy policy and cookies' - 'Cookies policy' must feature as a stand-alone link.\n\nIf it is possible also for you to include a small promotional box on the home page e.g.' How we use cookies' that would also help us deliver the requirement to signpost this information clearly. We can provide the text for this if it is possible.\n\nWhat you need to do\n\n*         Confirm to me that you can comply with our requirements in the timeframe required.\n\n*         Plan for updating your top (hygiene) or footer navigation for 14 May.\n\n*         Consider ability to feature a small home page promo or reference to cookies - wording to be provided by London 2012\n\n\nIf you have questions about how to implement this requirement, do contact me for clarification.\n\nMany thanks in advance for your helping us comply with this legislation!\n\nMorag Reavley\nSenior New Media Manager\nLondon Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\n1 Churchill Place\nCanary Wharf\nLondon\nDirect dial: 020 32012 160\nReception: 020 32012 000\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited\nA company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at One Churchill Place, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LN and registered number 05267819 \n          \nThis E-mail is confidential.

That is something you'll need to discuss with GDP.\n\n2/ Cultural Olympiad link\n\nWhat's is the URL for the \"filtered CO results\"?\n\nWe're currently using:\nhttp://www.london2012.com/get-involved/whats-on/#f_ProgrammeName%5B%5D=Cultural+Olympiad&pageNumber=1\n\nBut it looks like the games time site is just using this url (ie. join-in is replaced with get-involved) \nhttp://www.london2012.com/join-in/whats-on/#f_ProgrammeName%5B%5D=Cultural+Olympiad&pageNumber=1\n\nCan I just check the correct url before we update anything?\n\n3/ I also notice that on Internet explorer, PNG files (with transparent background) appear with a brown background.\n\nIt's a known problem with PNG's on certain versions of IE (it's not a CMS/site issue) although fairly sure CogApp who created the HTML used a little bit of code that normally works roudn this issue. Which version of IE were you seeing the problem in? It shouldn't happen (even without the transparency workaround) in later versions (ie. 8/9)\n\nIf your not using them on a patterned background the quick fix might be to re-create without a transparent layer ie. just on a white background.\n\n4/ \"Create an artist image gallery\"\n\nI didn't see your email, but I believe the solution is to select the \"group\" tab in the toolbar and then add more picture cells using the + button.\n\nJamie","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":161948746,"created_at":"2012/05/08 17:18:04 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Thanks Jamie\n\n\n1.
