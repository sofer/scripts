Although we will need to setup new accounts and API keys for yourself (or your developers) to access these API's. I expect you will also require a small amount of handholding / help in understanding the format of these API's (as they were a one off there is no documentation for them). Although we would expect the effort required to get you up to speed / for us to make any necessary changes to suit you import/requirements to be modest (for example we worked with the games time developers to migrate the current content to the games time website in just over a week). It probably makes sense for us to agree on a rough allowance of days towards to end of the summer with regards to this work (let me know if you would like me to make an extremely rough estimate now for budgetary purposes, say for 5 days work on helping you manage the export, although do bear in mind that this may change, up or down, once we understand your exact needs in more detail)\r\n\r\nIn terms of other things that may (or may not) be required (as I understood it, it was only the content you are interested in and not snapshots of the site as fully formed thing). \r\n\r\n- Content that falls outside of key content (news, blogs, photos, press releases, publications) ie. the \"about us\" or \"sponsors\" page.\r\nThere is a large amount of content that falls outside of what we have termed above as 'key content' this ranges from  the \"about us\" page to the \"young leaders\" or \"get involved\" sections.\r\nAll this content is available for export in a similar format to news, blogs etc. but may be much less well formed (ie. a news story always has a date, author, summary paragraph etc.) but a hub page for  \"young leaders\" may juts be a few paragraphs of text and/or a list of team members. The good news is that it will all be available if required, the downside is we may need to write some additional export API's for you and spend a little longer working with you so that you can make use/sense of this data (although our export format is fairly self describing).\r\n\r\n- Images\r\nI assume LOOCG have the rights to all the images (that they have received via Getty) and this is simply handed onto you as part of the legacy agreement.\r\n\r\n- Festival site\r\nI am assuming that the content from the festival site (festival.london2012.com) will not make us the museum site, do let me know if my assumption is wrong as although the site can be exported it may require slightly more effort in terms of creating that export.\r\n\r\n- Switch off of the website vs the CMS\r\nIt may be the case that LOCOG IT decide to switch of the website prior to us switching off the CMS. The current 2012 CMS instance will stay live till at least the end of the year (as we manage that part). However the BT web infrastructure hosting the current site may be switched off post the games in September (waiting on confirmation on this either way). This shouldn't present a problem as all the content will still be held in our CMS/database. Where it may impact you is if you wish to view/navigate the current website in preparation for the Museum site (in the worse case we could republish the site elsewhere for you to view it if required).\r\n\r\n- A complete (working) 'snapshot' of the website (looking as it does now) as static HTML. \r\nAlthough it is not possible to supply a fully working copy of the site as static html, due to there being sections of the site that will not work standalone as static HTML (ie. the search). We could supply a copy of the HTML+PHP code that currently resides on the server if required. If this is required it will need to be requested prior to the decommissioning of the live BT servers (which I believe is the end of the year although could be as soon as the end of games). Another avenue is to spider the current website now, with an offline website scrapping application and/or talk to Akamai (who current cache the website) to see if they can supply a 'snapshot' of their cache. \r\n\r\n- \"Snapshots in time\" of the website \r\nWe could not be able to supply these, however waybackmachine/the internet archive has snapshots of the site back to the bid site in 2004 :-) \r\nIt may be worth speaking to these guys in terms of what you could do re. snapshots of the site? This would also cover the above requirement of a static copy of the site.\r\nhttp://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://www.london2012.com\r\n\r\nIn summary, all the content is available as XML, some (news, blogs) is highly structured and tagged other content is more freeform (and therefore may be harder to re-use in an automated way). The CMS and DB will be available to export from till the end of the year (but we are happy to keep it live longer, we just need to discuss timescales/costs if this is the case). There may be a modest cost in terms of us helping you manage the export (happy to give an estimate, but we should resume the conversation later this year). In terms of 'snapshots' or access to the site as it current stands (ie. as a complete website not in terms of content) you may be best to talk to the guys at Akamai or the internet archive (as they have already crawled and archived the site, including snapshots over time).\r\n\r\nHope that all helps, feel free to send over any other questions..\r\n\r\nIf I don't speak to you before have a great summer, enjoy the games and hopefully speak to you later in the year.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n","via_id":0,"attachments":[]}],"ticket_field_entries":[{"created_at":"2012/03/22 15:14:39

That seems tends to be the common way to handle GeoBlocking of videos (namely restrict the stream, rather than the code that retrieves the url/path to the stream).\n\nIn short I am not sure we need to be involved for TwoFour to geo-block a video, surely they just can restrict the stream based on the users IP? the request for the video will come from the users browser and hence their IP address (not ours).\n\nHope that makes sense...\n\nJamie","via_id":4,"attachments":[]}],"ticket_field_entries":[{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:49 +0100","ticket_field_id":95936,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:49 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 16:08:45 +0100","ticket_field_id":97116,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/04/30 13:27:29 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":110059,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":147056,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/05/02 16:43:39 +0100","value":"capped"},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":148059,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 16:08:45 +0100","ticket_field_id":177410,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/04/30 13:27:29 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 16:08:45 +0100","ticket_field_id":358835,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/04/30 13:27:29 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":361219,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":380790,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":381640,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":440663,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/03/27 14:00:50 +0100","ticket_field_id":486619,"ticket_id":211218638,"updated_at":"2012/03/27 16:08:44 +0100","value":"1"}],"linkings":[]},{"assigned_at":"2012/04/20 16:00:51 +0100","assignee_id":3686603,"assignee_name":"Jamie Unwin","base_score":20,"created_at":"2012/04/20 15:39:50 +0100","current_collaborators":null,"current_tags":"billable files images its","description":"Begin forwarded message:\n\n> From: Andy Watkins <Andy.Watkins@london2012.com>\n> Date: 20 April 2012 14:51:53 GMT+01:00\n> To: Jamie Unwin <jamie@kitsite.com>\n> Subject: RE: Updated TB Images\n> \n> Hi Jamie,\n>  \n> Just tried to call your mobile.

We’re not embedding them.\"\n\nYes, exactly (PDT/YL are not embeds). But they still have the old global footer on them (esp. YL) which we will need to suppress if the site/section is accessed via a non www domain ie. pdt.london2102.com (it's far to complex/ugly to make a completely new copy under a new domain and then edit that copy).\n\nAs an aside, I should clarify that if you go direct to youngleaders.london2102.com we will have to redirect you to youngleaders.london2102.com/young-leaders/ (youngleaders.london2102.com is simply an alias to www.london2102.com, not a new site). We will however limit access to specific directories for any request from the youngleaders.london2102.com subdomain (so that post switchover people can't browse the rest of the current site)\n\n\"For website checker, I would rather you get the ticket stuff deployed into that domain\". In the case of the website checker the domain is largely irrelevant for now, www. and ticketchecker. will both display that page in exactly the same way. There is no harm in D3 getting their surrounding page ready / getting the correct height for the iframe set etc. (and then changing the domain later on).\n\nOr are you worried about giving D3 two sets of instructions/breaking the task into two (and would rather just give it to them in one go). Either way, once the domain is pointing at the server and IPSoft have added a sever alias for that subdomain you should be able to access the www site with either domain. (ticketchecker.london2012.com will in effect simply be an alias for www.london2012.com - everything else site structure will be identical/as it is now).\n\nps. post switchover if someone access ticketchecker.london2102.com direct we should probably redirect them back to the 'surrounding' ticket checker page on the GTW site (which will then in turn load the embed content at http://ticketchecker.london2012.com/gtw/ticketing-website-checker.php into an iFrame).

We could of course setup something like the EIF site, but it would:\n\n- Fall outside of the template set we currently have (so would require some additional deign/build work)\n- If you wanted the embed viewer, require us (or you) to setup an account with a PDF viewing/hosting service like Issuu [ http://issuu.com ] \n\nIt would probably involve 1 or 2 days work depending on the amount of design/build work involved (for a new template) and whether you needed us to handle all the work setting up Issuu (or a similar service). \n\nYou may also have to pay to use the Pro version of Issuu to the adverts (although I think thse only appear if you navigate to the publication via the Issue site and not if you are simply embedding the publication like on the EIF site).\n\nWe could simplify it somewhat by just having a image of the cover that you click to get the PDF, rather than using something like the Issuu embedded \"viewer\", although that would probably still require some design/build work.\n\nLet me know how you want to progress.\n\nJamie","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":161948746,"created_at":"2012/04/17 14:16:46 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Hi Jamie\n\nLet me get back to you on this.

Similarly, I’ve changed Nottingham (a)\nto just Nottingham.\n\n\n\n2. Denham and Shaldon are genuine communities but missing from the\nRegions mapping. Denham needs to be added to London, and Shaldon needs\nto be added to the South West.\n\n\n\n3. The others are all ‘moments’, which are generally short diversions\nto take in a famous place or landmark. In the rush to get the last\nrelease out we agreed these would not be accessible via the\nregion/communities search (they still appear in searches by name and\ndate), but we’ll need to address this on the GTW. We’ll either assign\nthem to the nearest actual community, using the macro, or include them\nin the communities list. I’ll confirm as soon as I can but I think the\nlatter option is probably the more palatable.\n\n\n\nKieran, could you apply the change in point 2 to the current TB search\npage, and process the updated extract attached?\n\n\n\nSteve, I’ve converted Kieran’s json file containing the communities to\nregions mapping into a spreadsheet, attached.

I had naively assumed that this problem was directly related to the technical issues that the 3rd party servers were experiencing at the end of last week. However it was slightly more complicated than that.\r\n\r\nFirstly, can you please use the \"News article\" template whenever you create news articles /anywhere/ on the website. I am not quite sure where the \"News article fr\" template came from but it should NOT be used. I am going to find out what it was used for and whether it can be deleted but ... until then (in fact, forever, going forward) can you use the \"News article\" template please?\r\n\r\nSecondly, there was an issue (which I've only just discovered) whereby manually-created pages in the French site were not being assigned a language of \"fr\", meaning that - even though they were in the French site - they were not appearing on the various French hubs. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\nIn short, if you create pages using the \"News article\" template, they should (now) get the correct language assigned to them and - when you publish them - they should appear on the site within a few minutes. I have not tested this all the way through (as I didn't want to place any test content on the live servers) but can you let me know (via this ticket) as soon as you try this, whether or not it works as expected.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nKieran\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","via_id":0,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":3663591,"created_at":"2012/04/16 17:03:07 +0100","is_public":false,"type":"Comment","value":"Ticket #9024 \"French website\" was closed and merged into this ticket.
