Unfortunately this change needs to be made a GDP's end.\n\nJamie \n\n==============\n\nJamie Unwin, Apr 19 02:10 pm (BST):\n\nWahome,\n\nAre you *sure* that won't just sort the results in date order, in effect throwing away any relevance?\n\nFor example if I search for \"Jazz\" \nhttp://festival.london2012.com/events/search.php?categoryIds=&searchString=jazz&searchLocation=Town+or+Postcode&startDate=From+Date&endDate=To+Date&event-search-submit=Find+Events\n\nThen I currently get the results back in relevance order with the event that best matches (or matches the most times) for the word \"Jazz\" ie. Wynton Marsalis' Swing Symphony\n\nHowever if I sorted the results by date, the last result may appear first, which happens to be a screening of silent Hitchcock films, which most people who search for Jazz probably think is totally irrelevant (it appears due to the line \"Sawhney is an Indian-British musician, producer and composer whose critically acclaimed work combines Asian and other worldwide influences with elements of jazz and electronica.\" in other words it has no real relevance to the event)\nhttp://festival.london2012.com/events/9000961780\n\nAs it is if we add in a (sortedBy=DATE) parameter we get Pina Bausch at the top (which while not as obscure as a match for Hitchcock isn't far of in terms of not being what you'd expect at the top result)\nhttp://festival.london2012.com/events/search.php?categoryIds=&searchString=jazz&searchLocation=Town+or+Postcode&startDate=From+Date&endDate=To+Date&sortedBy=DATE&event-search-submit=Find+Events\nI mention this as it the one of the thing we are always asked to change (when we build free text searches) and then asked to change back once the client realises that sorting a list of results (that are already sorted by relevance) is not what they want.\n\nAs Kieran said, we know exactly what you want to do and why, but just sorting your (already sorted by relevance) results by dates will result in you losing the relevance order.\n\nThe correct solution is to weight the results on both relevance + age (banding) so that the results become a mix of age+relevance (this is what Google does, the main www site search does and what you tend to expect when searching for News, Event or any other date based results)\n\nSimply date sorting your relevance sorted results, post relevant ordering, will simply result in the relevance information being lost.\n\nHappy to do it, just wanted to point out that it might not be what is expected / the pitfalls, before we did it..\n\nJamie\n\n==============\n\nWahome Muchiri, Apr 19 04:01 pm (BST):\n\nJamie, I'll let you know final word when I round up reactions from Festival\nmarketers.\n\nMy view is that unlike main 2012 site (and def google), Festival content is\nvery limited and highly focused that keyword searches will almost always\nreturn relevant results, even if not perfect (as with jazz).

Wynton Marsalis' Swing Symphony \n\nHowever if I sorted the results by date, the last result may appear first, which happens to be a screening of silent Hitchcock films, which most people who search for Jazz probably think is totally irrelevant (it appears due to the line \"Sawhney is an Indian-British musician, producer and composer whose critically acclaimed work combines Asian and other worldwide influences with elements of jazz and electronica.\" in other words it has no real relevance to the event)\nhttp://festival.london2012.com/events/9000961780\n\nAs it is if we add in a (sortedBy=DATE) parameter we get Pina Bausch at the top (which while not as obscure as a match for Hitchcock isn't far of in terms of not being what you'd expect at the top result)\nhttp://festival.london2012.com/events/search.php?categoryIds=&searchString=jazz&searchLocation=Town+or+Postcode&startDate=From+Date&endDate=To+Date&sortedBy=DATE&event-search-submit=Find+Events\n\nI mention this as it the one of the thing we are always asked to change (when we build free text searches) and then asked to change back once the client realises that sorting a list of results (that are already sorted by relevance) is not what they want.\n\nAs Kieran said, we know exactly what you want to do and why, but just sorting your (already sorted by relevance) results by dates will result in you losing the relevance order.\n\nThe correct solution is to weight the results on both relevance + age (banding) so that the results become a mix of age+relevance (this is what Google does, the main www site search does and what you tend to expect when searching for News, Event or any other date based results)\n\nSimply date sorting your relevance sorted results, post relevant ordering, will simply result in the relevance information being lost.\n\nHappy to do it, just wanted to point out that it might not be what is expected / the pitfalls, before we did it..\n\nJamie","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":88506071,"created_at":"2012/04/19 16:01:59 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Jamie, I'll let you know final word when I round up reactions from Festival\nmarketers.\n\nMy view is that unlike main 2012 site (and def google), Festival content is\nvery limited and highly focused that keyword searches will almost always\nreturn relevant results, even if not perfect (as with jazz).

Although these servers are live I don't think these are critical servers as they are serving a small user base.\n\nJD do you have any Iris contacts, they are not in my contact list?\n\nC\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Kieran Topping [notifications-support@postcms.zendesk.com<mailto:notifications-support@postcms.zendesk.com>]\nSent: Friday, March 30, 2012 11:07 PM GMT Standard Time\nTo: Chris Hudson\nSubject: [PostCMS support] Re: RE: Proactive Alert / BT Ref. 286767","via_id":4,"attachments":[]}],"ticket_field_entries":[{"created_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","ticket_field_id":95936,"ticket_id":210760113,"updated_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/05/03 10:55:01 +0100","ticket_field_id":97116,"ticket_id":210760113,"updated_at":"2012/05/03 10:55:01 +0100","value":"0.1"},{"created_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","ticket_field_id":110059,"ticket_id":210760113,"updated_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","ticket_field_id":147056,"ticket_id":210760113,"updated_at":"2012/05/03 10:55:01 +0100","value":"bill_to_tsd"},{"created_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","ticket_field_id":148059,"ticket_id":210760113,"updated_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/05/03 10:55:01 +0100","ticket_field_id":177410,"ticket_id":210760113,"updated_at":"2012/05/03 10:55:01 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/05/03 10:55:01 +0100","ticket_field_id":358835,"ticket_id":210760113,"updated_at":"2012/05/03 10:55:01 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","ticket_field_id":361219,"ticket_id":210760113,"updated_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","ticket_field_id":380790,"ticket_id":210760113,"updated_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","ticket_field_id":381640,"ticket_id":210760113,"updated_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","value":""},{"created_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","ticket_field_id":440663,"ticket_id":210760113,"updated_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","value":"0"},{"created_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","ticket_field_id":486619,"ticket_id":210760113,"updated_at":"2012/03/30 21:10:01 +0100","value":"0"}],"linkings":[]},{"assigned_at":"2012/05/02 16:58:36 +0100","assignee_id":3640926,"assignee_name":"Danny Sofer","base_score":20,"created_at":"2012/03/20 14:21:43 +0000","current_collaborators":"Wahome Muchiri","current_tags":"facebook its","description":"Hi Danny\n\nI would like to know how I can create a 'More info' button for the website.\n\nI am struggling with a specific event called Radio 1 Hackney.

The danger is that a users browser may (in the past) have attached application/octet-stream to some other application other than a PDF reader.\n\nJamie\n\n---\n\nHow the PDF is handled (ie view in the browser vs download vs view in acrobat) is set by the users browser. I think what you are referring to when you say 'force download' is a trick some sites use of setting the type to something unknown (application/octet-stream is the common one) in order that the browser pops up a dialog and asks the user what they want to do.

I think what you are referring to when you say 'force download' is a trick some sites use of setting the type to something unknown (application/octet-stream is the common one) in order that the browser pops up a dialog and asks the user what they want to do. The downside to this is the users machine won't know it's a PDF file as we've told the browser it's something else (it's only the file extension .pdf that means the PDF sometimes gets reunited with its correct type once downloaded - but this isn't guaranteed)\n\nI would suggest a a more correct solution is to put a comment under the link telling users to right click if they wish to save the file somewhere on their machine. \n\nThe solution (of setting an unknown file type) is a hack (we would be deliberately sending incorrect information to the browser, to force the browser to ask us what to do) which may well have its own issues. \n\n2/ urls / redirects\n\nwww.london2012.com and festival.london2012.com are separate domains/sites there is no sensible way of mapping /festival to festival.london2012.com that is transparent to the user.\n\nAlthough the official URL may be www.london2012.com/festival the site is festival.london2012.com. Not only are they different domain names, they are different web sites, on different servers.\n\nwww.london2012.com/festival is simply a redirect to where the site is hosted.\n\nTo make the site appear under /festival without the URL changing, we'd actually need to move the site so that it physically lived within the /festival of the main www site (which technically isn't possible)\n\nSee also /shop and shop.london2012.com and /tickets an tickets.london2012.com\n\nHope that makes sense \n\nJamie\n\nSent from my iPad","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":161948746,"created_at":"2012/05/01 09:40:12 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Hi Jamie\n\n\n1.

It is also worth bearing in mind that for an individual user the way PDF's are handled (by their browser) on the Festival site will be exactly the same as they are handled on other sites.\n\nI realise the brochure has lots of extra information in it and it's nice to have a PDF you can browse offline on a tablet device like an iPad (I often find that an overview or daily PDF I can print out is especially useful at festivals and conferences). But I am still slightly confused by is why, when you have a lovely website that is searchable by event / date / region along with up to date editorial content, are you directing users towards what is basically a PDF of a print publication :-)\n\nJamie","via_id":4,"attachments":[]},{"author_id":161948746,"created_at":"2012/05/01 14:35:48 +0100","is_public":true,"type":"Comment","value":"Hi Jamie\n\nThanks for the insight – these are instructions from the big bosses to direct people to go see and download the brochure.
